			Comment: `Disable WindowPoSt provable sector readability checks.

In normal operation, when preparing to compute WindowPoSt, lotus-miner will perform a round of reading challenges
from all sectors to confirm that those sectors can be proven. Challenges read in this process are discarded, as
we're only interested in checking that sector data can be read.

When using builtin proof computation (no PoSt workers, and DisableBuiltinWindowPoSt is set to false), this process
can save a lot of time and compute resources in the case that some sectors are not readable - this is caused by
the builtin logic not skipping snark computation when some sectors need to be skipped.

When using PoSt workers, this process is mostly redundant, with PoSt workers challenges will be read once, and
if challenges for some sectors aren't readable, those sectors will just get skipped.

Disabling sector pre-checks will slightly reduce IO load when proving sectors, possibly resulting in shorter
time to produce window PoSt. In setups with good IO capabilities the effect of this option on proving time should
be negligible.

NOTE: It likely is a bad idea to disable sector pre-checks in setups with no PoSt workers.

NOTE: Even when this option is enabled, recovering sectors will be checked before recovery declaration message is
sent to the chain

After changing this option, confirm that the new value works in your setup by invoking
'lotus-miner proving compute window-post 0'`,

A single partition may contain up to 2349 32GiB sectors, or 2300 64GiB sectors.

The maximum number of sectors which can be proven in a single PoSt message is 25000 in network version 16, which
means that a single message can prove at most 10 partinions

In some cases when submitting PoSt messages which are recovering sectors, the default network limit may still be
too high to fit in the block gas limit; In those cases it may be necessary to set this value to something lower
than 10; Note that setting this value lower may result in less efficient gas use - more messages will be sent,
