			Comment: `Disable WindowPoSt provable sector readability checks.

In normal operation, when preparing to compute WindowPoSt, lotus-miner will perform a round of reading challenges
from all sectors to confirm that those sectors can be proven. Challenges read in this process are discarded, as
we're only interested in checking that sector data can be read.

When using builtin proof computation (no PoSt workers, and DisableBuiltinWindowPoSt is set to false), this process
can save a lot of time and compute resources in the case that some sectors are not readable - this is caused by
the builtin logic not skipping snark computation when some sectors need to be skipped.

When using PoSt workers, this process is mostly redundant, with PoSt workers challenges will be read once, and
if challenges for some sectors aren't readable, those sectors will just get skipped.

Disabling sector pre-checks will slightly reduce IO load when proving sectors, possibly resulting in shorter
time to produce window PoSt. In setups with good IO capabilities the effect of this option on proving time should
be negligible.

NOTE: It likely is a bad idea to disable sector pre-checks in setups with no PoSt workers.

NOTE: Even when this option is enabled, recovering sectors will be checked before recovery declaration message is
sent to the chain

stagger the number of prove commits submitted per epoch
This is done because gas estimates for ProveCommits are non deterministic and increasing as a large
number of sectors get committed within the same epoch resulting in occasionally failed msgs.
Submitting a smaller number of prove commits per epoch would reduce the possibility of failed msgs`,

Splitstore GC will NOT run moving GC if the total size of the move would get
within 50 GB of the target, and instead will run a more aggressive online GC.
If both HotStoreFullGCFrequency and HotStoreMaxSpaceTarget are set then splitstore
GC will trigger moving GC if either configuration condition is met.
A reasonable minimum is 2x fully GCed hotstore size + 50 G buffer.
At this minimum size moving GC happens every time, any smaller and moving GC won't
be able to run. In spring 2023 this minimum is ~550 GB.`,
