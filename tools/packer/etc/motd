Your lotus node is up and running!

This image contains the two most important pieces of the lotus filecoin suite, the
daemon and the miner. The daemon is is configured to download a snapshot and start
running. In fact, by the time you read this, the daemon may already be in sync.
Go ahead and make sure everything is working correctly with the following commands.



To check if the daemon is running:

     systemctl status lotus-daemon



To check if the daemon is in sync:

    lotus sync status

    **note: When starting lotus for the first time, it will download a chain snapshot.
            This is a large download and will take several minutes to complete. During
            this time, the lotus API will not be up yet. Give it time! You can see
	    progress by looking at the systemd journal.


To check if the daemon is connecting to other lotus nodes:

    lotus net peers



No wallets are crated by default. You can view, create, and delete wallets with
the lotus command. On this image, lotus is running as the user `fc`.
Be careful, now. Don't delete a wallet with funds!

    sudo -E -u fc lotus wallet list
    sudo -E -u fc lotus wallet new bls



The lotus miner is also installed, but it's not running by default. If you have no
special disk or worker requirements, you can initialize the lotus-miner repo like this:

    sudo -E -u fc lotus-miner init -o <wallet_you_created_before>



You only need to do this once, after which, you can enable and start the miner.

    sudo systemctl enable lotus-miner
    sudo systemctl start lotus-miner
