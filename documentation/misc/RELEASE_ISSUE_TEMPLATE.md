   - Link to PR:
   - There likely aren't any changes at this point, but this can be opened with a small whitespace change so the PR is open and we can more easily hold the standard of making improvements incrementally since improvements are usually better done by collecting changes/notes along the way rather than just thinking about it at the end.
   - This will get merged in a `Post Release` step.
<!--{{if eq .Level "patch"}})-->
- [ ] (patch release) Fork a new branch (`release/v{{.Tag}}` or `release/miner/v{{.Tag}}`) from the last stable `release/vX.Y.x` or `release/miner/vX.Y.x` and make any further release-related changes to this branch.
<!--{{end}}-->
<!--{{if eq .Level "minor"}}-->

   - Skip this set of steps if you are patching a previous minor release.
   - [ ] bump the version(s) in `build/version.go` to `v{{.NextTag}}-dev`.
      - Ensure to update the appropriate version string based on whether you are creating a node release (`NodeBuildVersion`), a miner release (`MinerBuildVersion`), or both.
   - [ ] Run `make gen && make docsgen-cli` before committing changes.
   - [ ] Update the CHANGELOG
     - [ ] Change the `UNRELEASED` section header to `UNRELEASED v{{.Tag}}`

**Backport PR**

[//]: # (For RC1 there likely isn't any backporting to do and thus no PR which reduces the steps.)
[//]: # (We do need all these steps for RC2 onwards though.)
[//]: # (If steps are removed for the RC1 checklist, they need to be preserved for future RCs/stable.)
[//]: # (For RC1 we still need to make sure the tracked items land though.)
- [ ] All explicitly tracked items from `Dependencies for releases` have landed
- [ ] Backported [everything with the "backport" label](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues?q=label%3Arelease%2Fbackport+)

- [ ] Run `make gen && make docsgen-cli` to generate documentation
- [ ] Create a draft PR with title `build: release Lotus {{.Type}} v{{.Tag}}-rcX`
   - Link to PR:

      - Example `gh` cli command looking at merged PRs into master and sorted by title to group similar areas (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the start search date): `gh pr list --repo filecoin-project/lotus --search "base:master merged:>YYYY-MM-DD" --json number,mergedAt,author,title | jq -r '.[] | [.number, .mergedAt, .author.login, .title] | @tsv' | sort -k4`
    - [ ] Update the PR with the commit(s) made to the CHANGELOG

 - [ ] Update `üö¢ Estimated shipping date` table
 - [ ] Comment on this issue announcing the RC
    - Link to issue comment:

**Testing**
> [!NOTE]
> Link to any special steps for testing releases beyond ensuring CI is green.  Steps can be inlined here or tracked elsewhere.

### Stable (non-RC) Release

[//]: # (This "NOTE" below with the "diff" to apply to the "rcX copy/pasted content" is here to avoid the duplication in the template itself.)
[//]: # (This is done as a visible NOTE rather than a comment to make sure it's clear what needs to be added to this section.)
[//]: # (These comments ^^^ can be removed once the NOTE steps below are completed.)
> [!NOTE]
> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Copy/paste in the `rcX` section above to below this `[!Note]`
>
> 2Ô∏è‚É£ make these changes:
> 1. Release PR > Update the version string...
>    * Update the version string in `build/version.go` to one **NOT** ending with '-rcX'
> 2. Release PR > Changelog prep...
>    * Add "(network upgrade) Ensure the Mainnet upgrade epoch is specified."
> 3. Release PR > Create a draft PR...
>    * Create a PR with title `build: release Lotus {{.Type}} v{{.Tag}}`

### Post-Release

- [ ] Open a PR against `master` cherry-picking the CHANGELOG commits from the `release/v{{.Tag}}` branch. Title it `chore(release): cherry-pick v{{.Tag}} changelog back to master`
   - Link to PR:
   - Assuming we followed [the process of merging changes into `master` first before backporting to the release branch](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/LOTUS_RELEASE_FLOW.md#branch-and-tag-strategy), the only changes should be CHANGELOG updates.
- [ ] Finish updating/merging the [RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/misc/RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) PR from `Before RC1` with any improvements determined from this latest release iteration.
