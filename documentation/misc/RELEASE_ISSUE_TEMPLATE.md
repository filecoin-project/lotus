### Stable (non-RC)
- [ ] To Be Added

## ‚úÖ Release Checklist

### Before RC1
- [ ] (network upgrade) Make sure all [Lotus dependencies are updated to the correct versions for the network upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/misc/Update_Dependencies_Lotus.md)
   - Link to Lotus PR:
- [ ] Open PR against [RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/misc/RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) with title `docs(release): vX.Y.Z release template improvements` for improving future releases.
   - Link to PR:
   - There likely aren't any changes at this point, but this can be opened with a small whitespace change so the PR is open and we can more easily hold the standard of making improvements incrementally since improvements are usually better done by collecting changes/notes along the way rather than just thinking about it at the end.
   - This will get merged in a `Post Release` step.
- [ ] (patch release) Fork a new branch (`release/vX.Y.Z` or `release/miner/vX.Y.Z`) from the last stable `release/vX.Y.Z` or `release/miner/vX.Y.Z` and make any further release-related changes to this branch.
- [ ] (minor release) Fork a new branch (`release/vX.Y.Z` or `release/miner/vX.Y.Z`) from `master` and make any further release-related changes to this branch.
- (minor release) `master` branch Version string updates
   - [ ] bump the version(s) in `build/version.go` to `vX.Y.(Z+1)-dev`. 
      - Ensure to update the appropriate version string based on whether you are creating a node release (`NodeBuildVersion`), a miner release (`MinerBuildVersion`), or both.
   - [ ] Run `make gen && make docsgen-cli` before committing changes.
   - [ ] Remove the contents in the `Unreleased Changelog` section.
   - [ ] Create a PR with title `build: update Lotus Node|Miner version to vX.Y.Z+1-dev in master`

**Backport PR**

[//]: # (For RC1 there likely isn't any backporting to do and thus no PR which reduces the steps.)
[//]: # (We do need all these steps for RC2 onwards though.)
[//]: # (If steps are removed for the RC1 checklist, they need to be preserved for future RCs/stable.)
[//]: # (For RC1 we still need to make sure the tracked items land though.)

- [ ] Create a PR with title `build: release Lotus node|miner vX.Y.Z-rcX`
   - Link to PR:

- [ ] Changelog prep
   - [ ] Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases) and copy the auto generated changelog into your release PR and adjust the changelog accordingly.
   - [ ] Editorial review (e.g., callout breaking changes, new features, FIPs, actor bundles)
   - [ ] (network upgrade) Specify whether the Calibration or Mainnet upgrade epoch has been specified or not yet.
      - Example where these weren't specified yet: [PR #12169](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12169)

      - Example `gh` cli command looking at merged PRs into master and sorted by title to group similar areas (where `YYYY-MM-DD` is the start search date): `gh pr list --repo filecoin-project/lotus --search "base:master merged:>YYYY-MM-DD" --json number,mergedAt,author,title | jq -r '.[] | [.number, .mergedAt, .author.login, .title] | @tsv' | sort -k4`
- [ ] Merge the PR
   - Opening the PR will trigger a CI run that will build assets, attach the assets to the GitHub release, publish the GitHub release, and create the corresponding git tag.
 - [ ] Update `üö¢ Estimated shipping date` table
 - [ ] Comment on this issue announcing the RC
    - Link to issue comment:   

### Testing
> [!NOTE]
> Link to any special steps for testing releases beyond ensuring CI is green.  Steps can be inlined here or tracked elsewhere.

### Stable (non-RC) Release

[//]: # (This "NOTE" below with the "diff" to apply to the "RC copy/pasted content" is here to avoid the duplication in the template itself.)
[//]: # (This is done as a visible NOTE rather than a comment to make sure it's clear what needs to be added to this section.)
[//]: # (These comments ^^^ can be removed once the NOTE steps below are completed.)
> [!NOTE]
> Copy/paste in the `RCX` section above and then make these changes:
> 1. Under "Release PR > Update the version string...", edit:
> 
> Update the version string in `build/version.go` to one **NOT** ending with '-rcX'
>
> 2. Under "Release PR > Changelog prep...", add:
> 
> (network upgrade) Ensure the Mainnet upgrade epoch is specified.
>
> 3. Under "Release PR > Update the version string...", edit:
>
> Create a PR with title `build: release vX.Y.Z`
>
> 4. Remove this `[!Note]` and the related invisible comments.

### Post-Release

- [ ] Open a pull request against `master` cherry-picking the CHANGELOG commits from the `release/vX.Y.Z` branch. 
   - Link to PR: 
   - Assuming we followed [the process of merging changes into `master` first before backporting to the release branch](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/LOTUS_RELEASE_FLOW.md#branch-and-tag-strategy), the only changes should be CHANGELOG updates.  
- [ ] Finish updating/merging the [RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/misc/RELEASE_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) PR from `Before RC1` with any improvements determined from this latest release iteration.
