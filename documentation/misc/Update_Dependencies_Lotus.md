# Updating Lotus Dependencies

This guide will walk through how to update the most common dependencies in Lotus. These are the dependencies this guide currently covers:

- [Ref-FVM](#updating-ref-fvm)
- [Filecoin-FFI](#updating-filecoin-ffi)
- [Go-State-Types](#updating-go-state-types)
- [Builtin-Actors](#updating-builtin-actors)

## Updating Ref-FVM

1. The Ref-FVM dependency is updated through Filecoin-FFI. So, if you need to update Ref-FVM, you would need create a Filecoin-FFI PR similar to this: [PR updating Ref-FVM in Filecoin-FFI](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi/pull/447)

2. After the PR has been merged you would need to create a [new Filecoin-FFI release](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-ffi?tab=readme-ov-file#release-process).

3. After the Filecoin-FFI release is out, you can follow the process outlined in [Filecoin-FFI](#updating-filecoin-ffi).

## Updating Filecoin-FFI

1. In your `lotus` directory, `cd extern/filecoin-ffi`.

2. `git fetch` to ensure you have the latests changes for *filecoin-ffi*.

3. `git checkout vX.XX.X` to checkout the version you want to update to.

4. Then commit the update to your Lotus branch and open a PR for updating Filecoin-FFI.

## Updating Go-State-Types

1. In LotusÂ´s [go.mod file](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/go.mod), search for `go-state-types` and update the version to your wanted version.

2. Run `go mod tidy`, and commit your changes.

## Updating Builtin-Actors

1. In your `lotus` directory, `cd build/actors`.

2. Run this script `./pack.sh vXX vXX.X.X-rcX` to pull in the builtin-actors bundle into your Lotus repo.

- `vXX.X.X-rcX` is the builtin-actors release you are bundling.
