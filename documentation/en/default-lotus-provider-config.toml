  # we're only interested in checking that sector data can be read.
  # 
  # When using builtin proof computation (no PoSt workers, and DisableBuiltinWindowPoSt is set to false), this process
  # can save a lot of time and compute resources in the case that some sectors are not readable - this is caused by
  # the builtin logic not skipping snark computation when some sectors need to be skipped.
  # 
  # When using PoSt workers, this process is mostly redundant, with PoSt workers challenges will be read once, and
  # if challenges for some sectors aren't readable, those sectors will just get skipped.
