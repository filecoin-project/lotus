  # BoostAdapters is a list of tuples of miner address and port/ip to listen for market (e.g. boost) requests.

  # 
  # When a market node like boost gives Curio's market RPC a deal to placing into a sector, Curio will first store the
  # deal data in a temporary location "Piece Park" before assigning it to a sector. This requires that at least one
  # node in the cluster has the EnableParkPiece option enabled and has sufficient scratch space to store the deal data.
  # This is different from lotus-miner which stored the deal data into an "unsealed" sector as soon as the deal was
  # received. Deal data in PiecePark is accessed when the sector TreeD and TreeR are computed, but isn't needed for
  # the initial SDR layers computation. Pieces in PiecePark are removed after all sectors referencing the piece are
  # sealed.

  # To get API info for boost configuration run 'curio market rpc-info'
