Lotus is an implementation of the **Filecoin Distributed Storage Network**.

It is written in Go and provides a suite of command-line applications:

- Lotus Node (`lotus`): a Filecoin Node: validates network transactions, manages a FIL wallet, can perform storage and retrieval deals.
- Lotus Miner (`lotus-miner`): a Filecoin miner. See the the respective Lotus Miner section in the Mine documentation.
- Lotus Worker (`lotus-worker`): a worker that assists miners to perform mining-related tasks. See its respective guide for more information.
