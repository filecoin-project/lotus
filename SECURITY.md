# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

For *critical* bugs, please consult our Security Policy and Responsible Disclosure Program information at https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/blob/master/SECURITY.md

Please try to provide a clear description of any bugs reported, along with how to reproduce the bug if possible. More detailed bug reports (especially those with a PoC included) will help us move forward much faster. Additionally, please avoid reporting bugs that already have open issues. Take a moment to search the issue list of the related GitHub repositories before writing up a new report.

Here are some examples of bugs we would consider 'critical':

* If you can spend from a `multisig` wallet you do not control the keys for.
* If you can cause a miner to be slashed without them actually misbehaving.
* If you can maintain power without submitting windowed posts regularly.
* If you can craft a message that causes lotus nodes to panic.
* If you can cause your miner to win significantly more blocks than it should.
* If you can craft a message that causes a persistent fork in the network.
* If you can cause the total amount of Filecoin in the network to no longer be 2 billion.

This is not an exhaustive list, but should provide some idea of what we consider 'critical'.

## Reporting a non security bug

For non-critical bugs, please simply file a GitHub [issue](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
