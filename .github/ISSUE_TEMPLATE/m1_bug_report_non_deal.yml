      This is where you get to tell us what went wrong, when doing so, please try to provide a clear and concise description of the bug with all related information:
      * What you were doding when you experienced the bug?
      * Any *error* messages you saw, *where* you saw them, and what you believe may have caused them (if you have any ideas).
      * What is the expected behaviour?
      * For sealing issues, include the output of `lotus-miner sectors status --log <sectorId>` for the failed sector(s).

      Please provide debug logs of the problem, remember you can get set log level control for:
      * lotus: use `lotus log list` to get all log systems available and set level by `lotus log set-level`. An example can be found [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/configuration-and-advanced-usage/#log-level-control).
      * lotus-miner:`lotus-miner log list` to get all log systems available and set level by `lotus-miner log set-level
      If you don't provide detailed logs when you raise the issue it will almost certainly be the first request I make before furthur diagnosing the problem.
