Description: A Filecoin Storage Provider implementation.
 This Filecoin Storage Provider implementation is a fork of the Lotus project.
 It improves upon the previous by solving more complete problem sets including
 avoiding single points of failure, improving performance, and providing a
 more robust and scalable solution.
 It needs to be run in conjunction with the Filecoin network daemon and requires
 setup of a Miner-ID and a Wallet-ID. See documentation on the website for more
