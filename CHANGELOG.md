# Lotus changelog

# 1.18.0 / 2022-11-15

> ⚠️ **Please note that from Lotus v1.17.2&^ will require a Go-version of v1.18.1&^**

This is the final release of the upcoming MANDATORY release of Lotus that introduces [Filecoin network v17,
codenamed the Shark upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=top#discussioncomment-3825422). Shark upgrade delivers a wave of protocol refinements that will allow for useful smart contracts to be written using the FVM (eg. programmable markets, lending contracts, etc.).

**The Filecoin mainnet is scheduled to upgrade to nv17 at epoch 2383680, on Nov 30th on 2022-11-30T14:00:00Z. All node operators, including storage providers, must upgrade to this release before that time. Storage providers must update their daemons, miners, market and worker(s)/boost.**

The Shark upgrade introduces the following FIPs, delivered in [actors v9](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases/tag/v9.0.3):
- [FIP0029 Beneficiary Address for Storage Providers](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0029.md): step towards better lending market for SP
- [FIP0034 Fix PreCommit Deposit Independent of Sector Content](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0034.md): resolves a significant weakening of Filecoin PoRep’s security guarantees
  - ❗Pre-commit deposit will be calculated as the 20-day projection of expected reward earned by a sector with **a sector quality of 10 (i.e. full of verified deals)**, regardless of sector content. The Initial Pledge value, due when the sector is proven, is left **unchanged**.
- [FIP0041 Forward Compatibility for PreCommit](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0041.md): enables a cleaner and easier transition to Programmable Storage Markets
- [FIP0044 Standard Message Authentication](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0044.md): enable metadata authentication for user defined actor
- [FIP0045 Decoupling Fil+ from Marketplace](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0045.md): DataCap and the 10x QAP is now only associated with how long DATA is wanted to be stored on the network.
  - This is a transitional state to enabling far more efficient and dynamic storage markets on Filecoin network in the future.
  - ⭐️ First Fungible Token Contract - Datacap Actor, on Filecoin!  ([fungible token standard](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FRCs/frc-0046.md), [token contract library](https://github.com/helix-onchain/filecoin/tree/5455f4f831e0f3f20005a9a789623d7ad6dada15/frc46_token)).
  - For storage deal participants (clients and storage providers):
    - `PublishStorageDeals`/`ProveCommit(Aggregate)`/`ProveReplicaUpdates` message that includes verified deals will see a gas usage increase, more details can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/385f069b3b146c5fef4fdc1109a0e2f35f399e48/FIPS/fip-0045.md?plain=1#L784)
    -  `Term` is introduced for defining how long the DataCap is assigned to a piece of data. Anyone who cares about that piece of data may extend the _term_, which incentives SPs to store the data longer on the network without a new deal/resealing.
    - There is no  more diluted verified deal QAP due to deal/sector space time for new sectors that contains verified deals after this upgrade.
    - SPs may enjoy 90 days of extra QAP than deal duration by default, given `term_max` is always `deal duration + 90 days`.
❗ We highly recommend all lotus users, especially storage providers, developers and clients to read the FIPs in detail to understand the protocol changes and potential impact to network participants!
      
## Snapshots

The [#fil-infra](https://filecoinproject.slack.com/archives/C039RBG3RPC) team at PL has launched a brand new Lightweight Filecoin Chain Snapshots Service to support chain management needs for the node operators, check [here](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/Lightweight-Filecoin-Chain-Snapshots-17e4c386f35c44548f5863afb7b5e024) for the full detail. 
We are planning to switch [the snapshot service listed in lotus docs](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/manage/chain-management/#lightweight-snapshot) to the new Lightweight Filecoin Chain Snapshots Service by EOY, and deprecate public support of the current snapshots production. We recommend all users to test and switch the new service ASAP, and if you run into any issue, please report them [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/filecoin-chain-archiver/discussions/new?category=feedback) and the team would be happy to support you! For the main differences between the old & the new service, checkout the FAQ section [here](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/Lightweight-Filecoin-Chain-Snapshots-17e4c386f35c44548f5863afb7b5e024)

## Migration 

We are expecting a heavier than normal state migration for this upgrade due to the amount of the state changes introduced.
All node operators, including storage providers, should be aware that two pre-migrations are being scheduled. The first pre-migration will begin at 2022-11-30T12:00:00Z (120 minutes before the real upgrade), the second pre-migration will begin at 2022-11-30T13:45:00Z (7.5 minutes before the real upgrade). 
The first pre-migration will take up to 1.5hr, depending on the amount of the historical state in the node blockstore and the hardware specs the node is running on. During this time, expect slower block validation times, increased CPU and memory usage, and longer delays for API queries. 
We recommend node operators (who haven't enbabled splistore `universal` mode) that do not care about historical chain states, to prune the chain blockstore by syncing from a snapshot 1-2 days before the upgrade.
Note to full archival node operators: you may expect a migration that takes up to 20 min upon the upgrade, during this period your node will fall out of sync and your chain service may have some disruption. However, you can expect the node to catch up soon after the migration completes.

### v9 Built-in actor bundles

Bundles for all networks(mainnet, calibnet, and etc) are included in the lotus source tree (`build/actors/`) and embedded on build, for v9 actors you can find it [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/build/actors/v9.tar.zst). 
Reminder: Lotus verifies that the bundle CIDs are the right ones upon build & upgrade against the values in `build/builtin_actors_gen.go`, according to the network you are building. You may also check the bundle manifest CID matches the bundle gen-ed values by running `lotus state actor-cids --network-version 17`.

The manifest CID & full list of actor code CIDs for nv17 using [actor v9](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases/tag/v9.0.3) is:

# v1.17.2 / 2022-10-05

This is an OPTIONAL release of Lotus. This feature release introduces new sector number management APIs in Lotus that enables all the Sealing-as-a-Service and Lotus interactions needed to function. The default propagation delay setting for storage providers has also been changed, as well as numerous other features and enhancements. Check out the sub-bullet points in the feature and enhancement section to get a short description about each feature and enhancements.

### Highlights

🦭 **SaaS** 🦭
New sector management APIs makes it possible to import partially sealed sectors into Lotus. This release implements all SaaS<->Lotus interactions needed for such services to work. Deep dive into the new APIs here: https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/9079#discussioncomment-3652044

⏳ **Propagation delay** ⌛️
In v1.17.2 the default PropagationDelay has been raised from 6 seconds -> 10 seconds, and you can tune this yourself with the `PROPAGATION_DELAY_SECS` environment variable. This means you will now wait for 10 seconds for other blocks to arrive from the network before computing a winningPoSt (if eligible). In your `lotus-miner` logs that means you will see this "baseDeltaSeconds": 10 as default.

⚠️ **Please note that Lotus v1.17.2 will require a Go-version of v1.18.1 or higher!**

## New features
- feat: sealing: Partially sealed sector import ([filecoin-project/lotus#9210](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9210))
  - Implements support for importing (partially) sealed sectors which is needed for enabling external sealing services.
- feat: sealing: Use bitfields to manage sector numbers ([filecoin-project/lotus#9183](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9183))
  - Needed for Sealing-as-a-Service. Move sector number assigning logic to use stored bitfields instead of stored counters. Makes it possible to reserve ranges of sector numbers, see the sector assigner state and view sector number reservations.
- feat: env: propagation delay ([filecoin-project/lotus#9290](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9290))
  - The default propagation delay is raised to 10 seconds from 6 seconds. Ability to set it yourself with the `PROPAGATION_DELAY_SECS` environment variable.
- feat: cli: lotus info cmd ([filecoin-project/lotus#9233](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9233))
  - A new `lotus info` command that prints useful node information in one place.
- feat: proving: Introduce manual sector fault recovery (#9144) ([filecoin-project/lotus#9144](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9144))
  - Allow users to declare fault recovery messages manually with the `lotus-miner proving recover-faults` command, rather than waiting for it to happen automatically before windowPost.
- feat: api: Reintroduce StateActorManifestCID ([filecoin-project/lotus#9201](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9201))
  - Adds ability to retrieve the Actor Manifest CID through the api.
- feat: message: Add uuid to mpool message sent to chain node from miner ([filecoin-project/lotus#9174](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9174))
  - Adds a UUID to each message sent by the `lotus-miner` to the daemon. A requirement needed for https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/9130
- feat: message: Add retries to mpool push message from lotus-miner ([filecoin-project/lotus#9177](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9177))
  - Retries to mpool push message API in case of unavailability of the lotus chain node.

**Network 17 related features :**
- feat: network: add nv17 and integrate the corresponding go state type ([filecoin-project/lotus#9267](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9267))
- feat: cli: print beneficiary info in state miner-info ([filecoin-project/lotus#9308](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9308))
- feat: api/cli: change beneficiary propose and confirm for actors and multisigs. ([filecoin-project/lotus#9307](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9307))
- feat: api/cli: beneficiary withdraw api and cli ([filecoin-project/lotus#9296](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9296))

## Enhancements
- feat: sectors renew --only-cc ([filecoin-project/lotus#9184](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9184))
  - Exlude extending deal-related sectors with the `--only-cc` option when using the `lotus-miner sectors renew`
- feat: miner: display updated & update-cache for storage list ([filecoin-project/lotus#9323](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9323))
  - Show amount of `updated` & `update-cache` sectors in each storage path in the `lotus-miner storage list` output
- feat: add descriptive errors to markets event handler ([filecoin-project/lotus#9326](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9326))
  - More descriptive market error logs
- feat: cli: Add option to terminate sectors from worker address ([filecoin-project/lotus#9291](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9291))
  - Adds a flag to allow either owner address or worker address to send terminate sectors message.
- fix: cli: actor-cids cli command now defaults to current network ([filecoin-project/lotus#9321](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9321))
  - Makes the command defaults to the current network.
- fix: ux: Output bytes in `lotus client commP` cmd ([filecoin-project/lotus#9189](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/9189))

  - configure `MaxPartitionsPerPoStMessage` in miner configuration setting.
  
# 1.16.0 / 2022-06-24

This is a MANDATORY release of Lotus that introduces [Filecoin network v16,
codenamed the Skyr upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-2392151).

The network is scheduled to upgrade to nv16 at epoch 1960320, on July 6th at 2022-07-06T14:00:00Z. All node operators, including storage providers, must upgrade to this release (or a later release) before that time. Storage providers must update their daemons, miners, market and worker(s).

Your lotus node will switch from the Legacy VM (that depended on go-based specs-actors) to Filecoin Virtual Machine FVM (that uses Rust-based builtin-actors) atomically upon the upgrade.

The Skyr upgrade introduces the following FIPs, enhancements and bug fixes, delivered in [built-actors v8](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases/tag/v8.0.0) and [ref-fvm v1.0.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/releases/tag/fvm%40v1.0.0):,

- [FIP-0030](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0030.md)
- [FIP-0031](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0031.md)
- [FIP-0032](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0032.md))
- [FIP-0027](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0027.md)
- [Bug fix for the ProveReplicaUpdates method](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/pull/138)
- [New proofs version for SnarkPack](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/pull/474/commits/3027c365f516e1cba6f156d4fb9dbd8c893d5b62)


## 🆕 Things you may wanna know

### Actor Code CIDs

As stated in [FIP-0031](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0031.md)- [structure of the code cid](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0031.md#structure-of-code-cids), system actors' code CIDs will be real content-addressing

For lotus users, we are making the change minimal for you. This means the `CODE` output when you run `lotus state get-actor` will now be the actual CID that represents the executable code for the actor, followed by wrapped synthetic id like the ones you've got before, i.e `fil/8/system`.

Moreover, this also means that in the future, whenever the actor code changes, the CID changes accordingly, and a network upgrade is needed for the network participants to have consensus over what executable code we should use for each system actor.

### Built-in actor bundles

As the network introduces FVM, it's also switching from spec-actor (written in GoLang) to [built-in actor](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors) (written in rust), in which the latter comes with[ importable bundles](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors#importable-bundle). This means, like filecoin proof parameters, node operators now also need to fetch the actor bundles according to the network versions for the nodes to remain operational.

Bundles for all networks(mainnet, calibnet, and etc) are included in the lotus source tree (`build/actors/`) and embedded on build. Lotus verifies that the bundle CIDs are the right ones upon build & upgrade against the values in `build/builtin_actors_gen.go`, according to the network you are building. You may also check the bundle manifest CID matches the bundle gen-ed values by running `lotus state actor-cids --network-version 16`.

The manifest CID & full list of actor code CIDs for nv16 using v8.0.0 is:

```
    "_manifest":         "bafy2bzacebogjbpiemi7npzxchgcjjki3tfxon4ims55obfyfleqntteljsea"
	"account":          "bafk2bzacedudbf7fc5va57t3tmo63snmt3en4iaidv4vo3qlyacbxaa6hlx6y"

	"verifiedregistry": "bafk2bzaceb3zbkjz3auizmoln2unmxep7dyfcmsre64vnqfhdyh7rkqfoxlw4"
```

All bundles are also available at https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases, thus you can also manually download the bundles and place them in the right path.

Note: use customized bundle will risk you to lose sync with the network!

To get Code CIDs:
- api:`StateActorCodeCIDs`
- cli: `lotus state actor-cids`
- cli: `lotus-shed cid inspect-bundle`

### Execution Trace

For developers that are dependent on lotus execution trace, you will need  to enable `LOTUS_VM_ENABLE_TRACING` envvar to get the exact execution trace response as before. Without the envvar enabled, `Subcall` details, Duration` and `GasCharges` fields will be missing from the new FVM trace.

### Deal Proposal Migration

All deal proposals with non-utf8 string as the label in the metadata store will perform a light migration to new format as defined in [v1.1.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-fil-markets/pull/721).

## Others
- Resource manager is now only enabled by default on full daemon node. You can enable it manually for other nodes by setting env var `LOTUS_RCMGR` to `1`.

# 1.15.2 / 2022-05-06

This is a highly recommended feature lotus release v1.15.2. This feature release introduces many new features and  for SPs, including PoSt workers, sealing scheduler, snap deal queue and so on.

Note: You need to be using go v1.18.1&up from this release onwards.

## Highlights
### ❣️❣️❣️ PoSt Workers ❣️❣️❣️
‼️️Attention - the long-awaited yet highly requested PoSt workers, they are here! And they come in as a combo: you may setup PoSt workers for both winningPoSt or/and windowPoSt worker. You can also setup any number of PoSt workers as long as you have the hardware resources!
For more details and learn how to set it up, see the docs [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/seal-workers/post-workers/). You can also find early result of the PoSt workers performance by the community [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/8375).
- feat: PoSt workers ([filecoin-project/lotus#7971](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7971))
- feat: storage: Parallel proving checks ([filecoin-project/lotus#8391](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8391))
  - adjust `ParallelCheckLimit` according to your resource setup to get pre-post checkers run faster!

In addition, we also added some handy toolings:
- feat: miner: API/CLI to compute window-post ([filecoin-project/lotus#8389](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8389))
  - run `lotus-miner proving compute window-post` to manually trigger a full windowPoSt computation for a specific deadline for full sanity checks.
- feat: miner cli: Separate proving workers command ([filecoin-project/lotus#8379](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8379))
  - run `lotus-miner proving workers` to list all the PoSt workers that's attached
- feat: miner cli: proving check --faulty, faults in storage list sectors ([filecoin-project/lotus#8349](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8349))
  - run `lotus-miner proving check --faulty` to identify the sectors that might be bad.

### 🔥🔥🔥 Sealing Scheduler Enhancement 🔥🔥🔥

Have you ever got a couple workers but only a few of them are super packed, while the rest are idling waiting for jobs? Now the task can be distributed more evenly with:
- feat: sched: Improve worker assigning logic ([filecoin-project/lotus#8447](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8447))

### 🌟🌟🌟 Snap Deal Enhancements 🌟🌟🌟

The Filecoin Network introduced Snap Deal with the network v15 OhSnap upgrade, and lotus shipped v1.14.0 with basic snappy support for SP to use this feature. Since then, we have received good ux feedbacks and bug reports from the community, and we are introducing a couple enhancement for SPs to better leverage this feature.

- feat: sealing: Sector upgrade queue ([filecoin-project/lotus#8330](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8330))
  - Snap up CCs to be ready for deals automatically, learn more [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/snap-deals/#snap-deal-queue)
- feat: sealing: More SnapDeals config knobs ([filecoin-project/lotus#8343](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8343))
  - SPs can now set `PreferNewSectorsForDeals` and `MaxUpgradingSectors` to better manage their sealing/dealing pipeline.
- feat: config: Move MakeNewSectorForDeals config into the Sealing sectoin ([filecoin-project/lotus#8378](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8378))
- fix: sealing: Release unsealed sector files after snapdeals abort ([filecoin-project/lotus#8438](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8438))
- fix: sealing: always do cooldown in handleSubmitReplicaUpdateFailed ([filecoin-project/lotus#8353](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8353))
- fix: storagefsm: Fix error loop on bad event ([filecoin-project/lotus#8338](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8338))
- fix: sealing: Remove sector copies from workers after snapdeals ([filecoin-project/lotus#8329](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8329))

# 1.15.1 / 2022-04-07

This is a *HIGHLY recommended* feature release v1.15.1, especially for node operators and storage providers who want to be a part of the content addressing network of Filecoin and IPFS.
This feature release introduces Index Provider, GraphSync v2, and many other latest functionalities, improvements and bug fixes. More importantly, node operator can now enable the FVM(experimental) to sync mainnet!!

## Highlights

### 🔥🔥🔥 FVM (Experimental) 🔥🔥🔥
- feat: fvm: FVM integration  ([filecoin-project/lotus#8332](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8332))
  The lotus team is excited to announce the launch of experimental non-programmable FVM on mainnet. By enabling `"LOTUS_USE_FVM_EXPERIMENTAL=1` envvar, the lotus daemon will be running the [WASM-compiled built-in actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors) that is compatible with the existing chain(Network v15 OhSnap). If you are trying it out and having any questions or feedbacks, please leave a comment [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/8334)!
  - chore: FVM: log when fvm is used([filecoin-project/lotus#8363](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8363))
  - chore: ffi: the latest fvm release([filecoin-project/lotus#8382](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/8382))

### 🌟🌟🌟 Index Provider (Production Ready!) 🌟🌟🌟
- feat: markets: Integrate index ingest protocol and retrieve by any CID ([filecoin-project/lotus#7313](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7313))

More and more useful data is being stored on Filecoin via deals made by clients to Storage Providers. The goal is that this content is discoverable when people need them. To achieve that goal, one of the projects [the Bedrock team](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/Bedrock-2e956d5d8143432080a1d84435ccf0ff) is working on is building an Indexer Ecosystem, a project that's focus on content addressing on Filecoin, then potentially have interoperability with IPFS in the future and eventually serve the retrieval market. The Indexer Ecosystem high level architecture overview diagram can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/storetheindex/blob/main/doc/indexer_ecosys.png) and a detailed write up about can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/pl-strflt/Introducing-Indexer-to-SP-90bf296794174a8281c121d4ce6747a0).

That being said, with this release, lotus Storage Providers can easily become an Index Provider and serve the Indexer Content Addressing System. Index Providers generate advertisements from the deals made by a storage provider and announces the data to the indexer nodes for further processing:
- To learn more about *what is an Index Provider and how to be an Index Provider*, read it [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/index-provider/) in lotus docuementation.
- An [one-off migration](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/index-provider/#first-time-migration) is needed in order for a Storage Provider to become an Index Provider and announce the proper formatted index. It's *highly recommended* for all Index Provider to do a [force bulk initialization](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/configure/dagstore/#forcing-bulk-initialization) to enable index announcement on all existing deals.
  - Note that the Initialization places IO workload on your storage system. SP should set a proper `concurrency` based on your hardware or can stop/start initialization at their wish/convenience as proving deadlines approach and elapse, to avoid IOPS starvation or competition with window PoSt.
- After the first one-time migration, being an Index Provider barely puts any extra usage on SP's market system.
  - You can find the testing result by SPX fellows [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/8087).

We recommend all Storage Providers that are serving deals in the Filecoin network to become a Index Provider, make the data you are storing discoverable for the retrieval market and retrieval clients!
- If you have any questions about becoming an index provider, or the indexer system in general, leave a comment [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/8341).
- Follow the indexer project at https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-indexer-core.
- If you have any feature request or bug reports of running an index provider, create an issue in https://github.com/filecoin-project/index-provider.
- You may also join the #storetheindex channel in the Filecoin Slack to engage with the team & the community!

### ❗️❗️❗️ Dag Migration For New CAR index format in DagStore ❗️❗️❗️
The index provider leverages the latest CARv2 indexing format `MultihashIndexSorted`, which stores the multihash code as well as the digest of all CIDs in a CAR file. Thus, all Storage Providers SHOULD perform an one-off DAG mirgation to regenerate DagStore CARv2 indices. You have to do it to become an index provider, failing to do so may also impact your future deal making.
Follow the instruction [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/index-provider/) to perform the migration.

# 1.14.4 / 2022-03-03

This is a *highly recommended* optional release for storage providers that are doing snap deals. This fix the bug
that causes some snap deal sectors are stuck in `FinalizeReplicaUpdate`. In addition, SPs should be able to force
update sectors status without getting blocked by `normal shutdown of state machine`.

# v1.14.3 / 2022-02-28

This is an **optional** release, that includes a fix to properly register the `--really-do-it` flag for abort-upgrade.

# 1.14.2 / 2022-02-24

This is an **optional** release of lotus, that's had a couple more improvements w.r.t Snap experience for storage providers in preparation of the[upcoming OhSnap upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-1922550).

Note that the network is STILL scheduled to upgrade to v15 on March 1st at 2022-03-01T15:00:00Z. All node operators, including storage providers, must upgrade to at least Lotus v1.14.0 before that time. Storage providers must update their daemons, miners, and worker(s).

Wanna know how to Snap your deal? Check [this](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/8141) out!

## Bug Fixes
- fix lotus-bench for sealing jobs (#8173)
- fix:sealing:really-do-it flag for abort upgrade (#8181)
- fix:proving:post check sector handles snap deals replica faults (#8177)
- fix: sealing: missing file type (#8180)

## Others
- Retract force-pushed v1.14.0 to work around stale gomod caches (#8159): We originally tagged v1.14.0 off the wrong
  commit and fixed that by a force push, in which is a really bad practise since it messes up the go mod. Therefore,
  we want to retract it and users may use v1.14.1&^.

# 1.14.1 / 2022-02-18

This is an **optional** release of lotus, that fixes the incorrect *comment* of network v15 OhSnap upgrade **date**. Note the actual upgrade epoch in [v1.14.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.14.0) was correct.

# 1.14.0 / 2022-02-17

This is a MANDATORY release of Lotus that introduces [Filecoin network v15,
codenamed the OhSnap upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/community/discussions/74?sort=new#discussioncomment-1922550).

The network is scheduled to upgrade to v15 on March 1st at 2022-03-01T15:00:00Z. All node operators, including storage providers, must upgrade to this release (or a later release) before that time. Storage providers must update their daemons, miners, and worker(s).

The OhSnap upgrade introduces the following FIPs, delivered in [actors v7](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/releases/tag/v7.0.0):
- [FIP-0019 Snap Deals](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0019.md)
- [FIP-0028 Remove Datacap from Verified clients](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/pull/226)

It is recommended that storage providers download the new params before updating their node, miner, and workers. To do so:

- Download Lotus v1.14.0 or later
- run `make lotus-shed`
- run `./lotus-shed fetch-params` with the appropriate `proving-params` flag
- Upgrade the Lotus daemon and miner **when the previous step is complete**

All node operators, including storage providers, should be aware that a pre-migration will begin at 2022-03-01T13:30:00Z (90 minutes before the real upgrade). The pre-migration will take between 20 and 50 minutes, depending on hardware specs. During this time, expect slower block validation times, increased CPU and memory usage, and longer delays for API queries.

# v1.13.2 /  2022-01-09

Lotus v1.13.2 is a *highly recommended* feature release with remarkable retrieval improvements, new features like
worker management, schedule enhancements and so on.

## Highlights
- 🚀🚀🚀Improve retrieval deal experience
  - Testing result with MinerX.3 shows the retrieval deal success rate has increased dramatically with faster transfer
    speed, you can join or follow along furthur performance testings [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/7874). We recommend application developers to integrate with the new
    retrieval APIs to provide a better client experience.
  - 🌟🌟🌟 Reduce retrieval Time-To-First-Byte over 100x ([#7693](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7693))
    - This change makes most free, small retrievals sub-second
  - 🌟🌟🌟 Partial retrieval ux improvements ([#7610](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7610))
    - New retrieval commands for clients:
      - `lotus client ls`: retrieve and list desired object links
      - `lotus client cat`: retrieve and print the data from the network
    - 🌟🌟 The monolith `ClientRetrieve` method was broken into:
      - `ClientRetrieve` which retrieves data into the local repo (or into an IPFS node if ipfs integration is enabled)
      - `ClientRetrieveWait` which will wait for the retrieval to complete
      - `ClientExport` which will export data from the local node
      - Note: this change only applies to v1 API. v0 API remains unchanged.
    - 🌟 Support for full ipld selectors was added (for example making it possible to only retrieve list of directories in a deal, without fetching any file data)
      - To learn more, see [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/0523c946f984b22b3f5de8cc3003cc791389527e/api/types.go#L230-L264)
- 🚀🚀 Sealing scheduler enhancements ([#7703](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7703),
  [#7269](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7269)), [#7714](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7714)
  - Workers are now aware of cgroup memory limits
  - Multiple tasks which use a GPU can be scheduled on a single worker
  - Workers can override default resource table through env vars
    - Default value list: https://gist.github.com/magik6k/c0e1c7cd73c1241a9acabc30bf469a43
- 🚀🚀 Sector storage groups ([#7453](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7453))
  - Storage groups allow for better control of data flow between workers, for example, it makes it possible to define that data from PC1 on a given worker has to have it's PC2 step executed on the same worker
  - To set it up, follow the instructions under the `Sector Storage Group` section [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/docs/storage-providers/seal-workers/#lotus-worker-co-location)

# v1.13.0 / 2021-10-18

Lotus v1.13.0 is a *highly recommended* feature release for all lotus users(i.e: storage providers, data brokers, application developers and so on) that supports the upcoming
[Network v14 Chocolate upgrade](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/7431).
This feature release includes the latest functionalities and improvements, like data transfer rate-limiting for both storage and retrieval deals, proof v10 with CUDA support, etc. You can find more details in the Changelog below.

## Highlights
- Enable separate storage and retrieval transfer limits ([filecoin-project/lotus#7405](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7405))
  - `SimultaneousTransfer` is now replaced by `SimultaneousTransfersForStorage` and `SimultaneousTransfersForRetrieval`, where users may set the amount of ongoing data transfer for storage and retrieval deals in parallel separately. The default value for both is set to 20.
  - If you are using the lotus client, these two configuration variables are under the `Client` section in `./lotus/config.toml`.
  - If you are a service provider, these two configuration variables should be set under the `Dealmaking` section in `/.lotusminer/config.toml`.
- Update proofs to v10.0.0 ([filecoin-project/lotus#7420](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7420))
  - This version supports CUDA. To enable CUDA instead of openCL, build lotus with `FFI_USE_CUDA=1 FFI_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE=1 ...`.
  - You can find additional Nvidia driver installation instructions written by MinerX fellows [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/7443#discussioncomment-1425274) and perf improvements result on PC2/C2/WindowPoSt computation on different profiles [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/7443), most people observe a 30-50% decrease in computation time.

## New Features
- Feat/datamodel selector retrieval ([filecoin-project/lotus#6393](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/66393393))
  - This introduces a new RetrievalOrder-struct field and a CLI option that takes a string representation as understood by [https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-selector-text-lite#SelectorSpecFromPath](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipld/go-ipld-selector-text-lite#SelectorSpecFromPath). This allows for partial retrieval of any sub-DAG of a deal provided the user knows the exact low-level shape of the deal contents.
    - For example, to retrieve the first entry of a UnixFS directory by executing, run `lotus client retrieve --miner f0XXXXX --datamodel-path-selector 'Links/0/Hash' bafyROOTCID ~/output`
- Expose storage stats on the metrics endpoint ([filecoin-project/lotus#7418](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7418))
- feat: Catch panic to generate report and reraise ([filecoin-project/lotus#7341](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7341))
  - Set `LOTUS_PANIC_REPORT_PATH` and `LOTUS_PANIC_JOURNAL_LOOKBACK` to get reports generated when a panic occurs on your daemon miner or workers.
- Add envconfig docs to the config ([filecoin-project/lotus#7412](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7412))
  - You can now find supported env vars in [default-lotus-miner-config.toml](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/documentation/en/default-lotus-miner-config.toml).
- lotus shed: fr32 utils ([filecoin-project/lotus#7355](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7355))
- Miner CLI: Allow trying to change owners of any miner actor ([filecoin-project/lotus#7328](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7328))
- Add --unproven flag to the sectors list command ([filecoin-project/lotus#7308](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7308))

## Improvements
- check for deal start epoch on SectorAddPieceToAny ([filecoin-project/lotus#7407](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7407))
- Verify Voucher locks in VoucherValidUnlocked ([filecoin-project/lotus#5609](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5609))
- Add more info to miner allinfo command ([filecoin-project/lotus#7384](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7384))
- add `lotus-miner storage-deals list --format=json` with transfers ([filecoin-project/lotus#7312](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7312))
- Fix formatting ([filecoin-project/lotus#7383](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7383))
- GetCurrentDealInfo err: handle correctly err case ([filecoin-project/lotus#7346](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7346))
- fix: Enforce verification key integrity check regardless of TRUST_PARAMS=1 ([filecoin-project/lotus#7327](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7327))
- Show more deal states in miner info ([filecoin-project/lotus#7311](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7311))
- Prep retrieval for selectors: no functional changes ([filecoin-project/lotus#7306](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7306))
- Seed: improve helptext ([filecoin-project/lotus#7304](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7304))
- Mempool: reduce size of sigValCache ([filecoin-project/lotus#7305](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7305))
- Stop indirectly depending on deprecated github.com/prometheus/common ([filecoin-project/lotus#7474](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7474))

## Bug Fixes
- StateSearchMsg: Correct usage of the allowReplaced flag ([filecoin-project/lotus#7450](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/7450))

# v1.11.2 / 2021-09-06

lotus v1.11.2 is a feature release that's **highly recommended ALL lotus users to upgrade**, including node operators,
storage providers and clients.

## Highlights
- 🌟🌟🌟 Introduce Dagstore and CARv2 for deal-making (#6671) ([filecoin-project/lotus#6671](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6671))
  - **[lotus miner markets' Dagstore](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/dagstore/)** is a
    component of the `markets` subsystem in lotus-miner. It is a sharded store to hold large IPLD graphs efficiently,
    packaged as  location-transparent attachable CAR files and it replaces the former Badger staging blockstore. It
    is designed to provide high efficiency and throughput, and minimize resource utilization during deal-making operations.  
    The dagstore also leverages the indexing features of [CARv2](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/blob/master/specs/transport/car/carv2/index.md) to enable plan CAR files to act as read and write
    blockstores, which are served as the direct medium for data exchanges in markets for both storage and retrieval
    deal making without requiring intermediate buffers.
  - In the future, lotus will leverage and interact with Dagstore a lot for new features and improvements for deal
    making, therefore, it's highly recommended to lotus users to go through [Lotus Miner: About the markets dagstore](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/dagstore/) thoroughly to learn more about Dagstore's
    conceptual overview, terminology, directory structure, configuration and so on.
  - **Note**:
    - When you first start your lotus-miner or market subsystem with this release, a one-time/first-time **dagstore migration** will be triggered which replaces the former Badger staging blockstore with dagstore. We highly
      recommend storage providers to read this [section](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/dagstore/#first-time-migration) to learn more about
      what the process does, what to expect and how monitor it.
    - It is highly recommended to **wait all ongoing data transfer to finish or cancel inbound storage deals that
      are still transferring**, using the `lotus-miner data-transfers cancel` command before upgrade your market nodes. Reason being that the new dagstore changes attributes in the internal deal state objects, and the paths to the staging CARs where the deal data was being placed will be lost.
    - ‼️Having your dags initialized will become important in the near feature for you to provide a better storage
      and retrieval service. We'd suggest you to start [forced bulk initialization] soon if possible as this process
      places relatively high IP workload on your storage system and is better to be carried out gradually and over a
      longer timeframe. Read how to do properly perform a force bulk initialization [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/dagstore/#forcing-bulk-initialization).
    - ⏮ Rollback Alert(from v1.11.2-rcX to any version lower): If a storages deal is initiated with M1/v1.11.2(-rcX)
      release, it needs to get to the `StorageDealAwaitingPrecommit` state before you can do a version rollback or the markets process may panic.
  - 💙 **Special thanks to [MinerX fellows for testing and providing valuable feedbacks](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6852) for Dagstore in the past month!**
- 🌟🌟 rpcenc: Support reader redirect ([filecoin-project/lotus#6952](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6952))
  - This allows market processes to send piece bytes directly to workers involved on `AddPiece`.
- Extending sectors: more practical and flexible tools ([filecoin-project/lotus#6097](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6097))
  - `lotus-miner sectors check-expire` to inspect expiring sectors.
  - `lotus-miner sectors renew` for renewing expiring sectors, see the command help menu for customizable option
    like `extension`, `new-expiration` and so on.
- ‼️ MpoolReplaceCmd ( lotus mpool replace`) now takes FIL for fee-limit ([filecoin-project/lotus#6927](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6927))
- Drop townhall/chainwatch ([filecoin-project/lotus#6912](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6912))
  - ChainWatch is no longer supported by lotus.
- Configurable CC Sector Expiration ([filecoin-project/lotus#6803](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6803))
  - Set `CommittedCapacitySectorLifetime` in lotus-miner/config.toml to specify the default expiration for a new CC
    sector, value must be between 180-540 days inclusive.

# 1.11.1 / 2021-08-16

> Note: for discussion about this release, please comment [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6904)

This is a  **highly recommended** but optional Lotus v1.11.1 release that introduces many deal making and datastore improvements and new features along with other bug fixes.

## Highlights
- ⭐️⭐️⭐️[**lotus-miner market subsystem**](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/advanced-configurations/split-markets-miners/) is introduced in this release! It is **highly recommended** for storage providers to run markets processes on a separate machine! Doing so, only this machine needs to exposes public ports for deal making. This also means that the other miner operations can now be completely isolated by from the deal making processes and storage providers can stop and restarts the markets process without affecting an ongoing Winning/Window PoSt!
  - More details on the concepts, architecture and how to split the market process can be found [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/advanced-configurations/split-markets-miners/#concepts).
  - Base on your system setup(running on separate machines, same machine and so on), please see the suggested practice by community members [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/7047#discussion-3515335).
    - Note: if you are running lotus-worker on a different machine, you will need to set `MARKETS_API_INFO` for certain CLI to work properly. This will be improved by #7072.
  - Huge thanks to MinerX fellows for [helping testing the implementation, reporting the issues so they were fixed by now and providing feedbacks](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/6861) to user docs in the past three weeks!
- Config for collateral from miner available balance ([filecoin-project/lotus#6629](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6629))
  - Better control your sector collateral payment by setting `CollateralFromMinerBalance`, `AvailableBalanceBuffer` and `DisableCollateralFallback`.
    - `CollateralFromMinerBalance`:  whether to use available miner balance for sector collateral instead of sending it with each message, default is `false`.
    - `AvailableBalanceBuffer`: minimum available balance to keep in the miner actor before sending it with messages, default is 0FIL.
    - `DisableCollateralFallback`: whether to send collateral with messages even if there is no available balance in the miner actor, default is `false`.
- Config for deal publishing control addresses ([filecoin-project/lotus#6697](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6697))
  - Set `DealPublishControl` to set the wallet used for sending `PublishStorageDeals` messages, instructions [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/operate/addresses/#control-addresses).
- Config UX improvements ([filecoin-project/lotus#6848](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6848))
  - You can now preview the the default and updated node config by running `lotus/lotus-miner config default/updated`

# 1.10.1 / 2021-07-05

This is an optional but **highly recommended** release of Lotus for lotus miners that has many bug fixes and improvements based on the feedback we got from the community since HyperDrive.

## New Features
- commit batch: AggregateAboveBaseFee config #6650
  - `AggregateAboveBaseFee` is added to miner sealing configuration for setting the network base fee to start aggregating proofs. When the network base fee is lower than this value, the prove commits will be submitted individually via `ProveCommitSector`. According to the [Batch Incentive Alignment](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md#batch-incentive-alignment) introduced in FIP-0013, we recommend miners to set this value to 0.15 nanoFIL(which is the default value) to avoid unexpected aggregation fee in burn and enjoy the most benefits of aggregation!

## Bug Fixes
- storage: Fix FinalizeSector with sectors in storage paths #6652
- Fix tiny error in check-client-datacap #6664
- Fix: precommit_batch method used the wrong cfg.PreCommitBatchWait #6658
- to optimize the batchwait #6636
- fix getTicket: sector precommitted but expired case #6635
- handleSubmitCommitAggregate() exception handling #6595
- remove precommit check in handleCommitFailed #6634
- ensure agg fee is adequate
- fix: miner balance is not enough, so that ProveCommitAggregate msg exec failed #6623
- commit batch: Initialize the FailedSectors map #6647

# 1.10.0 / 2021-06-23

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that introduces Filecoin network v13, codenamed the HyperDrive upgrade. The
Filecoin mainnet will upgrade, which is epoch 892800, on 2021-06-30T22:00:00Z. The network upgrade introduces the
following FIPs:

- [FIP-0008](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0008.md): Add miner batched sector pre-commit method
- [FIP-0011](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0011.md): Remove reward auction from reporting consensus faults
- [FIP-0012](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0012.md): DataCap Top up for FIL+ Client Addresses
- [FIP-0013](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md): Add ProveCommitSectorAggregated method to reduce on-chain congestion
- [FIP-0015](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0015.md): Revert FIP-0009(Exempt Window PoSts from BaseFee burn)

Note that this release is built on top of Lotus v1.9.0. Enterprising users can use the `master` branch of Lotus to get the latest functionality, including all changes in this release candidate.

## Proof batching and aggregation

FIPs [0008](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0008.md) and [0013](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md) combine to allow for a significant increase in the rate of onboarding storage on the Filecoin network. This aims to lead to more useful data being stored on the network, reduced network congestion, and lower network base fee.

**Check out the documentation [here]((https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/advanced-configurations/sealing/#precommitsectorsbatch) for details on the new Lotus miner sealing config options, [here](https://lotus.filecoin.io/storage-providers/setup/configuration/#fees-section) for fee config options, and explanations of the new features.**

Note:
- We recommend to keep `PreCommitSectorsBatch` as 1.
- We recommend miners to set `PreCommitBatchWait` lower than 30 hours.
- We recommend miners to set a longer `CommitBatchSlack` and  `PreCommitBatchSlack` to prevent message failures
  due to expirations.

### Projected state tree growth

In order to validate the Hyperdrive changes, we wrote a simulation to seal as many sectors as quickly as possible, assuming the same number and mix of 32GiB and 64GiB miners as the current network.

Given these assumptions:

- We'd expect a network storage growth rate of around 530PiB per day. 😳 🎉 🥳 😅
- We'd expect network bandwidth dedicated to `SubmitWindowedPoSt` to grow by about 0.02% per day.
- We'd expect the [state-tree](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-systems.filecoin_vm.state_tree) (and therefore [snapshot](https://lotus.filecoin.io/lotus/manage/chain-management/#lightweight-snapshot)) size to grow by 1.16GiB per day.
  - Nearly all of the state-tree growth is expected to come from new sector metadata.
- We'd expect the daily lotus datastore growth rate to increase by about 10-15% (from current ~21GiB/day).
  - Most "growth" of the lotus datastore is due to "churn", historical data that's no longer referenced by the latest state-tree.

### Future improvements

Various Lotus improvements are planned moving forward to mitigate the effects of the growing state tree size. The primary improvement is the [Lotus splitstore](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/5788), which will soon be enabled by default. The feature allows for [online garbage collection](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/6577) for nodes that do not seek to maintain full chain and state history, thus eliminating the need for users to delete their datastores and sync from snapshots.

Other improvements including better compressed snapshots, faster pre-migrations, and improved chain exports are in the roadmap.

## WindowPost base fee burn

Included in the HyperDrive upgrade is [FIP-0015](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0015.md) which eliminates the special-case gas treatment of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages that was introduced in [FIP-0009](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0009.md). Although `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages will be relatively cheap, thanks to the introduction of optimistic acceptance of these proofs in [FIP-0010](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md), storage providers should pay attention to their `MaxWindowPoStGasFee` config option: too low and PoSts may not land on chain; too high and they may cost an exorbitant amount!

# 1.8.0 / 2021-04-05

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that upgrades the network to version 12, which introduces various performance improvements to the cron processing of the power actor. The network will upgrade at height 712320, which is 2021-04-29T06:00:00Z.

## Changes

- v4 specs-actors integration, nv12 migration (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6116)

# 1.6.0 / 2021-04-05

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that upgrades the network to version 11, which implements [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md). The network will upgrade at height 665280, which is 2021-04-12T22:00:00Z.

## v1 sector extension CLI

This release also expands the `lotus-miner sectors extend` CLI, with a new option that automatically extends all extensible v1 sectors. The option can be run using `lotus-miner sectors extend --v1-sectors`.

- The `tolerance` flag can be passed to indicate what durations aren't "worth" extending. It defaults to one week, which means that sectors whose current lifetime's are within one week of the maximum possible lifetime will not be extended.

- The `expiration-cutoff` flag can be passed to skip sectors whose expiration is past a certain point from the current head. It defaults to infinity (no cutoff), but if, say, 28800 was specified, then only sectors expiring in the next 10 days would be extended (2880 epochs in 1 day).

## Changes

- Util for miners to extend all v1 sectors (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5924)
- Upgrade the butterfly network (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5929)
- Introduce the v11 network upgrade (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5904)
- Debug mode: Make upgrade heights controllable by an envvar (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5919)

# 1.5.3 / 2021-03-24

This is a patch release of Lotus that introduces small fixes to the Storage FSM.

## Changes

- storagefsm: Fix double unlock with ready WaitDeals sectors (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5783)
- backupds: Allow larger values in write log (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5776)
- storagefsm: Don't log the SectorRestart event (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5779)

# 1.5.2 / 2021-03-11

This is an hotfix release of Lotus that fixes a critical bug introduced in v1.5.1 in the miner windowPoSt logic. This upgrade is only affecting miner nodes.

## Changes
- fix window post rand check (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5773)
- wdpost: Always use head tipset to get randomness (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5774)

# 1.5.1 / 2021-03-10

This is an optional release of Lotus that introduces an important fix to the WindowPoSt computation process. The change is to wait for some confidence before drawing beacon randomness for the proof. Without this, invalid proofs might be generated as the result of a null tipset.

## Splitstore

This release also introduces the splitstore, a new optional blockstore that segregates the monolithic blockstore into cold and hot regions. The hot region contains objects from the last 4-5 finalities plus all reachable objects from two finalities away. All other objects are moved to the cold region using a compaction process that executes every finality, once 5 finalities have elapsed.

The splitstore allows us to separate the two regions quite effectively, using two separate badger blockstores. The separation
means that the live working set is much smaller, which results in potentially significant performance improvements. In addition, it means that the coldstore can be moved to a separate (bigger, slower, cheaper) disk without loss of performance.

The design also allows us to use different implementations for the two blockstores; for example, an append-only blockstore could be used for coldstore and a faster memory mapped blockstore could be used for the hotstore (eg LMDB). We plan to experiment with these options in the future.

Once the splitstore has been enabled, the existing monolithic blockstore becomes the coldstore. On the first head change notification, the splitstore will warm up the hotstore by copying all reachable objects from the current tipset into the hotstore.  All new writes go into the hotstore, with the splitstore tracking the write epoch. Once 5 finalities have elapsed, and every finality thereafter, the splitstore compacts by moving cold objects into the coldstore. There is also experimental support for garbage collection, whereby nunreachable objects are simply discarded.

To enable the splitstore, add the following to config.toml:

```
[Chainstore]
  EnableSplitstore = true
```

## Highlights

Other highlights include:

- Improved deal data handling - now multiple deals can be adding to sectors in parallel
- Rewriten sector pledging - it now actually cares about max sealing sector limits
- Better handling for sectors stuck in the RecoverDealIDs state
- lotus-miner sectors extend command
- Optional configurable storage path size limit
- Config to disable owner/worker fallback from control addresses (useful when owner is a key on a hardware wallet)
- A write log for node metadata, which can be restored as a backup when the metadata leveldb becomes corrupted (e.g. when you run out of disk space / system crashes in some bad way)

# 1.5.0 / 2021-02-23

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that introduces the fifth upgrade to the Filecoin network. The network upgrade occurs at height 550321, before which time all nodes must have updated to this release (or later). At this height, [v3 specs-actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/releases/tag/v3.0.0) will take effect, which in turn implements the following two FIPs:

- [FIP-0007 h/amt-v3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0007.md) which improves the performance of the Filecoin HAMT and AMT.
- [FIP-0010 off-chain Window PoSt Verification](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md) which reduces the gas consumption of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages significantly by optimistically accepting Window PoSt proofs without verification, and allowing them to be disputed later by off-chain verifiers.

Note that the integration of v3 actors was already completed in 1.4.2, this upgrade simply sets the epoch for the upgrade to occur.

## Disputer

FIP-0010 introduces the ability to dispute bad Window PoSts. Node operators are encouraged to run the new Lotus disputer alongside their Lotus daemons. For more information, see the announcement [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/5617#discussioncomment-387333).

## Changes

- [#5341](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5341)  Add a  `LOTUS_DISABLE_V3_ACTOR_MIGRATION` envvar
  - Setting this envvar to 1 disables the v3 actor migration, should only be used in the event of a failed migration

# 1.4.2 / 2021-02-17

This is a large, and highly recommended, optional release with new features and improvements for lotus miner and deal-making UX. The release also integrates [v3 specs-actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/releases/tag/v3.0.0), which implements two FIPs:

- [FIP-0007 h/amt-v3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0007.md) which improves the performance of the Filecoin HAMT and AMT.
- [FIP-0010 off-chain Window PoSt Verification](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md) which reduces the gas consumption of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages significantly by optimistically accepting Window PoSt proofs without verification, and allowing them to be disputed later by off-chain verifiers.

Note that this release does NOT set an upgrade epoch for v3 actors to take effect. That will be done in the upcoming 1.5.0 release.

# 1.1.0 / 2020-10-20

This is a mandatory release that introduces the first post-liftoff upgrade to the Filecoin network. The changes that break consensus are an upgrade to specs-actors v2.2.0 at epoch 170000.

## Changes

- Introduce Network version 6 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4506)
- Update markets v1.0.0 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4505)

- Add a comment to BlockMessages to address #4446 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4491)

# 1.0.0 / 2020-10-19

It's 1.0.0! This is an optional release of Lotus that introduces some UX improvements to the 0.10 series.

This very small release is largely cosmetic, and intended to flag the code that the Filecoin mainnet was launched with.

## API changes

- `StateMsgGasCost` has been removed. The equivalent information can be gained by calling `StateReplay`.
- A `GasCost` field has been added to the `InvocResult` type, meaning detailed gas costs will be returned when calling `StateReplay`, `StateCompute`, and `StateCall`.
- The behaviour of `StateReplay` in response to an empty tipset key has been changed. Instead of simply using the heaviest tipset (which is almost guaranteed to be an unsuccessful replay), we search now search the chain for the tipset that included the message, and replay the message in that tipset (we fail if no such tipset is found).

## Changes

- Increase code coverage! (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4410)

# 0.5.0 / 2020-08-20

This version of Lotus will be used for the incentivized testnet Space Race competition,
and can be considered mainnet-ready code. It includes some protocol
changes, upgrades of core dependencies, and various bugfixes and UX/performance improvements.

## Highlights

Among the highlights included in this release are:

- Gas changes: We implemented EIP-1559 and introduced real gas values.
- Deal-making: We now support "Committed Capacity" sectors, "fast-retrieval" deals,
  and the packing of multiple deals into a single sector.
- Renamed features: We renamed some of the binaries, environment variables, and default
  paths associated with a Lotus node.

### Gas changes

We made some significant changes to the mechanics of gas in this release.

#### Network fee

We implemented something similar to
[Ethereum's EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
The `Message` structure had three changes:
- The `GasPrice` field has been removed
- A new `GasFeeCap` field has been added, which controls the maximum cost
  the sender incurs for the message
- A new `GasPremium` field has been added, which controls the reward a miner
  earns for including the message

A sender will never be charged more than `GasFeeCap * GasLimit`.
A miner will typically earn `GasPremium * GasLimit` as a reward.

The `Blockheader` structure has one new field, called `ParentBaseFee`.
Informally speaking,the `ParentBaseFee`
is increased when blocks are densely packed with messages, and decreased otherwise.

The `ParentBaseFee` is used when calculating how much a sender burns when executing a message. _Burning_ simply refers to sending attoFIL to a dedicated, unreachable account.
A message causes `ParentBaseFee * GasUsed` attoFIL to be burnt.

#### Real gas values

This release also includes our first "real" gas costs for primitive operations.
The costs were designed to account for both the _time_ that message execution takes,
as well as the _space_ a message adds to the state tree.

## Deal-making changes

There are three key changes to the deal-making process.

#### Committed Capacity sectors

Miners can now pledge "Committed Capacity" (CC) sectors, which are explicitly
stated as containing junk data, and must not include any deals. Miners can do this
to increase their storage power, and win block rewards from this pledged storage.

They can mark these sectors as "upgradable" with `lotus-miner sectors mark-for-upgrade`.
If the miner receives and accepts one or more storage deals, the sector that includes
those deals will _replace_ the CC sector. This is intended to maximize the amount of useful
storage on the Filecoin network.

#### Fast-retrieval deals

Clients can now include a `fast-retrieval` flag when proposing deals with storage miners.
If set to true, the miner will include an extra copy of the deal data. This
data can be quickly served in a retrieval deal, since it will not need to be unsealed.

#### Multiple deals per sector

Miners can now pack multiple deals into a single sector, so long as all the deals
fit into the sector capacity. This should increase the packing efficiency of miners.

### Renamed features

To improve the user experience, we updated several names to mainatin
standard prefixing, and to better reflect the meaning of the features being referenced.

In particular, the Lotus miner binary is now called `lotus-miner`, the default
path for miner data is now `~/.lotusminer`, and the environment variable
that sets the path for miner data is now `$LOTUS_MINER_PATH`. A full list of renamed
features can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/2304).
