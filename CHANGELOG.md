- feat: add experimental v2 APIs that are "F3 aware."  (TODO: expand this section significantly to cover where someone learns about the new APIs, how they enable them, and what expectations they should have around them‚Äîi.e., they may change)

# Node and Miner v1.32.2 / 2025-04-04

This Lotus v1.32.2 release is a **MANDATORY patch release**. After the Calibration network upgraded to nv25, a bug was discovered in the ref-fvm KAMT library affecting ERC-20 token minting operations. You can read the the full techincal breakdown of the issue [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/pull/1667).

This patch release includes the following updates:
- Schedules a mandatory Calibration upgrade, happening on `2025-04-07T23:00:00Z`, to fix the ERC-20 token minting bug on the Calibration network.
- Postpones the mandatory Mainnet nv25 upgrade by 4 days, to `2025-04-14T23:00:00Z`

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Upgrade Warnings ‚ò¢Ô∏è
- All Lotus node and Storage Provider (SP) operators must upgrade to this patch release before the specified dates for the Calibration and Mainnet networks.
- Please check the upgrade warning section for the [v1.32.1 release](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.32.1) for more upgrade warnings if you are upgrading from a version prior to v1.32.0.

## üì¶ v16 Builtin Actor Bundle

This release candidate uses the [v16.0.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/releases/tag/v16.0.1)

## üöö Migration
All node operators, including storage providers, should be aware that ONE pre-migration is being scheduled 120 epochs before the network upgrade. The migration for the NV25 upgrade is expected to be medium with a bit longer pre-migration compared to the two previous network upgrade.

Pre-Migration is expected to take between 4 to 8 minutes on a SplitStore node. The migration on the upgrade epoch is expected to take 30 seconds on a node with a NVMe-drive and a newer CPU. For nodes running on slower disks/CPU, it is still expected to take around 1 minute. We recommend node operators (who haven't enabled splitstore discard mode) that do not care about historical chain states, to prune the chain blockstore by syncing from a snapshot 1-2 days before the upgrade.

For certain node operators, such as full archival nodes or systems that need to keep large amounts of state (RPC providers), we recommend skipping the pre-migration and run the non-cached migration (i.e., just running the migration at the network upgrade epoch), and schedule for some additional downtime. Operators of such nodes can read the [How to disable premigration in network upgrade tutorial](https://lotus.filecoin.io/kb/disable-premigration/).

## Bug Fixes and Chores
- feat!: actors bundle v16.0.1 & special handling for calibnet ([filecoin-project/lotus#13006](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/13006)).
- chore: update new Mainnet nv25 date to 2025-04-14T23:00:00Z ([filecoin-project/lotus#13007](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/13007)).
- chore: make TockFix epoch for 2k network configurable ([filecoin-project/lotus#13008](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/13008)).
- chore(deps): update filecoin-ffi ([filecoin-project/lotus#13011](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/13011)).

## üìù Changelog

For the set of changes since the last stable release:

- Node: https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/compare/v1.31.1...v1.32.2
- Miner: https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/compare/v1.31.1...miner/v1.32.2

# Node and Miner v1.32.1 / 2025-03-28

The Lotus v1.32.1 release is a **MANDATORY patch release**, which will deliver the Filecoin network version 25, codenamed ‚ÄúTeep‚Äù ü¶µ. This release sets the upgrade epoch for the Mainnet to **Epoch 4867320 - 2025-04-10T23:00:00Z**, and correctly sets the F3 activationcontract address to `0xA19080A1Bcb82Bb61bcb9691EC94653Eb5315716`. You can find more details about how the F3 activation on Mainnet will be executed in the [F3 Activation Procedure](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-f3/issues/920#issuecomment-2761448485).

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Upgrade Warnings ‚ò¢Ô∏è
- The Lotus v1.32.0 release had an issue where the F3 activation contract address was not set correctly. This release corrects that issue.
- If you are running the v1.30.0 version of Lotus, please go through the Upgrade Warnings section for the [v1.31.0 releases](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.31.0) and [v1.31.1](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.31.1) before upgrading to this release.
- The minimum supported Golang version is now `1.23.6` ([filecoin-project/lotus#12910](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12910)).
- The `SupportedProofTypes` field has been removed from the `Filecoin.StateGetNetworkParams` method because it was frequently overlooked during proof type updates and did not accurately reflect the FVM's supported proofs ([filecoin-project/lotus#12881](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12881)).
- Introduced `Agent` field to the `Filecoin.Version` response. Note that this change may be breaking, depending on the clients deserialization capabilities. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12904](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12904)).
- The `--only-cc` option has been removed from the `lotus-miner sectors extend` command.

# Node v1.31.1 / 2025-01-27

This Lotus release introduces several new features and improvements, including JSON output for tipsets in `lotus chain list` cmd, enhanced logging during network upgrade migrations, and additional Bootstrap nodes. It also includes a refactored Ethereum API implementation into smaller, more manageable modules in a new `github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/node/impl/eth` package, as well as adding network name as a tag in most metrics - making it easier to create Graphana Dashboards for multiple networks. Please review the upgrade warnings and documentation for any important changes affecting RPC providers, node operators, and storage providers.

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è Upgrade Warnings ‚ò¢Ô∏è
- If you are running the v1.30.x version of Lotus, please go through the Upgrade Warnings section for the [v1.31.0](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/releases/tag/v1.31.0) before upgrading to this release.

## ‚≠ê Feature/Improvement Highlights:
- Add json output of tipsets to `lotus chain list`. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12691](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12691))
- During a network upgrade, log migration progress every 2 seconds so they are more helpful and informative. The `LOTUS_MIGRATE_PROGRESS_LOG_SECONDS` environment variable can be used to change this if needed. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12732](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12732))
- Add Magik's Bootstrap node. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12792](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12792))
- Lotus now reports the network name as a tag in most metrics. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12733](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12733))
- Add a new cron queue inspection utility. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12825](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12825))
- Add a new utility to the `lotus-shed msg` tool which pretty-prints gas summaries to tables, broken down into compute and storage gas totals and percentages ([filecoin-project/lotus#12817](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12817))
- Generate the cli docs directly from the code instead compiling and executing binaries' `help` output. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12717](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12717))
- Refactored Ethereum API implementation into smaller, more manageable modules in a new `github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/node/impl/eth` package. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12796](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12796))
- Add F3GetCertificate & F3GetLatestCertificate to the gateway. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12778](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12778))
- Add `StateMarketProposalPending` API / `lotus state market proposal-pending` CLI. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12724](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12724))

## üêõ Bug Fix Highlights
- Remove IPNI advertisement relay over pubsub via Lotus node as it now has been deprecated. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12768](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12768)
- Make `EthTraceFilter` / `trace_filter` skip null rounds instead of erroring. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12702](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12702))
- Event APIs (`GetActorEventsRaw`, `SubscribeActorEventsRaw`, `eth_getLogs`, `eth_newFilter`, etc.) will now return an error when a request matches more than `MaxFilterResults` (default: 10,000) rather than silently truncating the results. Also apply an internal event matcher for `eth_getLogs` (etc.) to avoid builtin actor events on database query so as not to include them in `MaxFilterResults` calculation. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12671](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12671))
- `ChainIndexer#GetMsgInfo` returns an `ErrNotFound` when there are no rows. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12680](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12680))
- Gracefully handle EAM CreateAccount failures in `EthTraceBlock` (`trace_block`) and `EthTraceTransaction` (`trace_transaction`) calls. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12730](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12730))
- Make f3 gen power command being non-deterministic ([filecoin-project/lotus#12764](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12764))

# Node and Miner v1.31.0 / 2024-12-02

The Lotus v1.31.0 release introduces the new `ChainIndexer` subsystem, enhancing the indexing of Filecoin chain state for improved RPC performance. Several bug fixes in the block production loop are also included. Please review the upgrade warnings and documentation for any important changes affecting RPC providers, node operators and storage providers.

## ‚≠ê New Feature Highlights:
- New ChainIndexer subsystem to index Filecoin chain state such as tipsets, messages, events and ETH transactions for accurate and faster RPC responses. The `ChainIndexer` replaces the existing `MsgIndex`, `EthTxHashLookup` and `EventIndex` implementations in Lotus, which [suffer from a multitude of known problems](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/12293).  If you are an RPC provider or a node operator who uses or exposes Ethereum and/or events APIs, please refer to the [ChainIndexer documentation for operators](./documentation/en/chain-indexer-overview-for-operators.md) for information on how to enable, configure and use the new Indexer.  While there is no automated data migration and one can upgrade and downgrade without backups, there are manual steps that need to be taken to backfill data when upgrading to this Lotus version, or downgrading to the previous version without ChainIndexer. Please be aware that that this feature removes some options in the Lotus configuration file, if these have been set, Lotus will report an error when starting. See the documentation for more information
- `lotus chain head` now supports a `--height` flag to print just the epoch number of the current chain head ([filecoin-project/lotus#12609](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12609))
- Implement `EthGetTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex` (`eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`) and `EthGetTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex` (`eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex`) methods. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12618](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12618))
- `lotus-shed indexes inspect-indexes` now performs a comprehensive comparison of the event index data for each message by comparing the AMT root CID from the message receipt with the root of a reconstructed AMT. Previously `inspect-indexes` simply compared event counts.  Comparing AMT roots instead confirms all the event data is byte-perfect. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12570](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12570))
- Return a "data" field on the "error" returned from RPC when `eth_call` and `eth_estimateGas` APIs encounter `execution reverted` errors. This is a standard expectation of Ethereum RPC tooling and may improve compatibility in some cases. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12553](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12553))
- Improve ETH-filter performance for nodes serving many clients. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12603](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12603))
- Implement F3 utility CLIs to list the power table for a given instance and sum the proportional power of a set of actors that participate in a given instance. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12698](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12698))

## üêõ Bug Fix Highlights
- Add logic to check if the miner's owner address is delegated (f4 address). If it is delegated, the `lotus-shed sectors termination-estimate` command now sends the termination state call using the worker ID. This fix resolves the issue where termination-estimate did not function correctly for miners with delegated owner addresses. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12569](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12569))
- The Lotus Miner will now always mine on the latest chain head returned by lotus, even if that head has less "weight" than the previously seen head. This is necessary because F3 may end up finalizing a tipset with a lower weight, although this situation should be rare on the Filecoin mainnet. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12659](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12659)) and ([filecoin-project/lotus#12690](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12690))
- Make the ordering of event output for `eth_` APIs and `GetActorEventsRaw` consistent, sorting ascending on: epoch, message index, event index and original event entry order. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12623](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12623))
- Return a consistent error when encountering null rounds in ETH RPC method calls. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12655](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12655))
- Correct erroneous sector QAP-calculation upon sector extension in lotus-miner cli. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12720](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12720))
- Return error if logs or events within range are not indexed. ([filecoin-project/lotus#12728](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/12728))

```

## üöö Migration

All node operators, including storage providers, should be aware that ONE pre-migration is being scheduled 120 epochs before the network upgrade. The migration for the NV24 upgrade is expected to be light with no heavy pre-migrations:

- Pre-Migration is expected to take less then 1 minute.
- The migration on the upgrade epoch is expected to take less than 30 seconds on a node with a NVMe-drive and a newer CPU. For nodes running on slower disks/CPU, it is still expected to take less then 1 minute.
- RAM usages is expected to be under 20GiB RAM for both the pre-migration and migration.

We recommend node operators (who haven't enabled splitstore discard mode) that do not care about historical chain states, to prune the chain blockstore by syncing from a snapshot 1-2 days before the upgrade.

For certain node operators, such as full archival nodes or systems that need to keep large amounts of state (RPC providers), we recommend skipping the pre-migration and run the non-cached migration (i.e., just running the migration at the network upgrade epoch), and schedule for some additional downtime. Operators of such nodes can read the [How to disable premigration in network upgrade tutorial](https://lotus.filecoin.io/kb/disable-premigration/).
