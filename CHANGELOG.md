# Lotus changelog

# 1.10.0 / 2021-06-23

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that introduces Filecoin network v13, codenamed the HyperDrive upgrade. The
Filecoin mainnet will upgrade, which is epoch 892800, on 2021-06-30T22:00:00Z. The network upgrade introduces the
following FIPs:

- [FIP-0008](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0008.md): Add miner batched sector pre-commit method
- [FIP-0011](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0011.md): Remove reward auction from reporting consensus faults
- [FIP-0012](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0012.md): DataCap Top up for FIL+ Client Addresses
- [FIP-0013](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md): Add ProveCommitSectorAggregated method to reduce on-chain congestion
- [FIP-0015](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0015.md): Revert FIP-0009(Exempt Window PoSts from BaseFee burn)

Note that this release is built on top of Lotus v1.9.0. Enterprising users can use the `master` branch of Lotus to get the latest functionality, including all changes in this release candidate.

## Proof batching and aggregation

FIPs [0008](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0008.md) and [0013](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0013.md) combine to allow for a significant increase in the rate of onboarding storage on the Filecoin network. This aims to lead to more useful data being stored on the network, reduced network congestion, and lower network base fee.

**Check out the documentation [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/lotus/miner-configuration/#precommitsectorsbatch) for details on the new Lotus miner sealing config options, [here](https://docs.filecoin.io/mine/lotus/miner-configuration/#fees-section) for fee config options, and explanations of the new features.**

Note:
  - We recommend to keep `PreCommitSectorsBatch` as 1.
  - We recommend miners to set `PreCommitBatchWait` lower than 30 hours.
  - We recommend miners to set a longer `CommitBatchSlack` and  `PreCommitBatchSlack` to prevent message failures
    due to expirations.

### Projected state tree growth

In order to validate the Hyperdrive changes, we wrote a simulation to seal as many sectors as quickly as possible, assuming the same number and mix of 32GiB and 64GiB miners as the current network.

Given these assumptions:

- We'd expect a network storage growth rate of around 530PiB per day. ðŸ˜³ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¥³ ðŸ˜…
- We'd expect network bandwidth dedicated to `SubmitWindowedPoSt` to grow by about 0.02% per day.
- We'd expect the [state-tree](https://spec.filecoin.io/#section-systems.filecoin_vm.state_tree) (and therefore [snapshot](https://docs.filecoin.io/get-started/lotus/chain/#lightweight-snapshot)) size to grow by 1.16GiB per day.
   - Nearly all of the state-tree growth is expected to come from new sector metadata.
- We'd expect the daily lotus datastore growth rate to increase by about 10-15% (from current ~21GiB/day).
   - Most "growth" of the lotus datastore is due to "churn", historical data that's no longer referenced by the latest state-tree.

### Future improvements

Various Lotus improvements are planned moving forward to mitigate the effects of the growing state tree size. The primary improvement is the [Lotus splitstore](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/5788), which will soon be enabled by default. The feature allows for [online garbage collection](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/6577) for nodes that do not seek to maintain full chain and state history, thus eliminating the need for users to delete their datastores and sync from snapshots.

Other improvements including better compressed snapshots, faster pre-migrations, and improved chain exports are in the roadmap.

## WindowPost base fee burn

Included in the HyperDrive upgrade is [FIP-0015](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0015.md) which eliminates the special-case gas treatment of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages that was introduced in [FIP-0009](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0009.md). Although `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages will be relatively cheap, thanks to the introduction of optimistic acceptance of these proofs in [FIP-0010](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md), storage providers should pay attention to their `MaxWindowPoStGasFee` config option: too low and PoSts may not land on chain; too high and they may cost an exorbitant amount!

# 1.8.0 / 2021-04-05

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that upgrades the network to version 12, which introduces various performance improvements to the cron processing of the power actor. The network will upgrade at height 712320, which is 2021-04-29T06:00:00Z.

## Changes

- v4 specs-actors integration, nv12 migration (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/6116)

# 1.6.0 / 2021-04-05

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that upgrades the network to version 11, which implements [FIP-0014](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0014.md). The network will upgrade at height 665280, which is 2021-04-12T22:00:00Z.

## v1 sector extension CLI

This release also expands the `lotus-miner sectors extend` CLI, with a new option that automatically extends all extensible v1 sectors. The option can be run using `lotus-miner sectors extend --v1-sectors`.

- The `tolerance` flag can be passed to indicate what durations aren't "worth" extending. It defaults to one week, which means that sectors whose current lifetime's are within one week of the maximum possible lifetime will not be extended.

- The `expiration-cutoff` flag can be passed to skip sectors whose expiration is past a certain point from the current head. It defaults to infinity (no cutoff), but if, say, 28800 was specified, then only sectors expiring in the next 10 days would be extended (2880 epochs in 1 day).

## Changes

- Util for miners to extend all v1 sectors (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5924)
- Upgrade the butterfly network (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5929)
- Introduce the v11 network upgrade (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5904)
- Debug mode: Make upgrade heights controllable by an envvar (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5919)

# 1.5.3 / 2021-03-24

This is a patch release of Lotus that introduces small fixes to the Storage FSM.

## Changes

- storagefsm: Fix double unlock with ready WaitDeals sectors (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5783)
- backupds: Allow larger values in write log (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5776)
- storagefsm: Don't log the SectorRestart event (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5779)

# 1.5.2 / 2021-03-11

This is an hotfix release of Lotus that fixes a critical bug introduced in v1.5.1 in the miner windowPoSt logic. This upgrade is only affecting miner nodes.

## Changes
- fix window post rand check (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5773)
- wdpost: Always use head tipset to get randomness (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5774)

# 1.5.1 / 2021-03-10

This is an optional release of Lotus that introduces an important fix to the WindowPoSt computation process. The change is to wait for some confidence before drawing beacon randomness for the proof. Without this, invalid proofs might be generated as the result of a null tipset.

## Splitstore

This release also introduces the splitstore, a new optional blockstore that segregates the monolithic blockstore into cold and hot regions. The hot region contains objects from the last 4-5 finalities plus all reachable objects from two finalities away. All other objects are moved to the cold region using a compaction process that executes every finality, once 5 finalities have elapsed.

The splitstore allows us to separate the two regions quite effectively, using two separate badger blockstores. The separation
means that the live working set is much smaller, which results in potentially significant performance improvements. In addition, it means that the coldstore can be moved to a separate (bigger, slower, cheaper) disk without loss of performance.

The design also allows us to use different implementations for the two blockstores; for example, an append-only blockstore could be used for coldstore and a faster memory mapped blockstore could be used for the hotstore (eg LMDB). We plan to experiment with these options in the future.

Once the splitstore has been enabled, the existing monolithic blockstore becomes the coldstore. On the first head change notification, the splitstore will warm up the hotstore by copying all reachable objects from the current tipset into the hotstore.  All new writes go into the hotstore, with the splitstore tracking the write epoch. Once 5 finalities have elapsed, and every finality thereafter, the splitstore compacts by moving cold objects into the coldstore. There is also experimental support for garbage collection, whereby nunreachable objects are simply discarded.

To enable the splitstore, add the following to config.toml:

```
[Chainstore]
  EnableSplitstore = true
```

## Highlights

Other highlights include:

- Improved deal data handling - now multiple deals can be adding to sectors in parallel
- Rewriten sector pledging - it now actually cares about max sealing sector limits
- Better handling for sectors stuck in the RecoverDealIDs state
- lotus-miner sectors extend command
- Optional configurable storage path size limit
- Config to disable owner/worker fallback from control addresses (useful when owner is a key on a hardware wallet)
- A write log for node metadata, which can be restored as a backup when the metadata leveldb becomes corrupted (e.g. when you run out of disk space / system crashes in some bad way)

# 1.5.0 / 2021-02-23

This is a mandatory release of Lotus that introduces the fifth upgrade to the Filecoin network. The network upgrade occurs at height 550321, before which time all nodes must have updated to this release (or later). At this height, [v3 specs-actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/releases/tag/v3.0.0) will take effect, which in turn implements the following two FIPs:

- [FIP-0007 h/amt-v3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0007.md) which improves the performance of the Filecoin HAMT and AMT.
- [FIP-0010 off-chain Window PoSt Verification](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md) which reduces the gas consumption of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages significantly by optimistically accepting Window PoSt proofs without verification, and allowing them to be disputed later by off-chain verifiers.

Note that the integration of v3 actors was already completed in 1.4.2, this upgrade simply sets the epoch for the upgrade to occur.

## Disputer

FIP-0010 introduces the ability to dispute bad Window PoSts. Node operators are encouraged to run the new Lotus disputer alongside their Lotus daemons. For more information, see the announcement [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions/5617#discussioncomment-387333).

## Changes

- [#5341](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5341)  Add a  `LOTUS_DISABLE_V3_ACTOR_MIGRATION` envvar
  - Setting this envvar to 1 disables the v3 actor migration, should only be used in the event of a failed migration

# 1.4.2 / 2021-02-17

This is a large, and highly recommended, optional release with new features and improvements for lotus miner and deal-making UX. The release also integrates [v3 specs-actors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/specs-actors/releases/tag/v3.0.0), which implements two FIPs:

- [FIP-0007 h/amt-v3](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0007.md) which improves the performance of the Filecoin HAMT and AMT.
- [FIP-0010 off-chain Window PoSt Verification](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0010.md) which reduces the gas consumption of `SubmitWindowedPoSt` messages significantly by optimistically accepting Window PoSt proofs without verification, and allowing them to be disputed later by off-chain verifiers.

Note that this release does NOT set an upgrade epoch for v3 actors to take effect. That will be done in the upcoming 1.5.0 release.

# 1.1.0 / 2020-10-20

This is a mandatory release that introduces the first post-liftoff upgrade to the Filecoin network. The changes that break consensus are an upgrade to specs-actors v2.2.0 at epoch 170000.

## Changes

- Introduce Network version 6 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4506)
- Update markets v1.0.0 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4505)
- Add some extra logging to try and debug sync issues (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4486)
- Circle: Run tests for some subsystems separately (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4496)
- Add a terminate sectors command to lotus-shed (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4507)
- Add a comment to BlockMessages to address #4446 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4491)

# 1.0.0 / 2020-10-19

It's 1.0.0! This is an optional release of Lotus that introduces some UX improvements to the 0.10 series.

This very small release is largely cosmetic, and intended to flag the code that the Filecoin mainnet was launched with.

## API changes

- `StateMsgGasCost` has been removed. The equivalent information can be gained by calling `StateReplay`.
- A `GasCost` field has been added to the `InvocResult` type, meaning detailed gas costs will be returned when calling `StateReplay`, `StateCompute`, and `StateCall`.
- The behaviour of `StateReplay` in response to an empty tipset key has been changed. Instead of simply using the heaviest tipset (which is almost guaranteed to be an unsuccessful replay), we search now search the chain for the tipset that included the message, and replay the message in that tipset (we fail if no such tipset is found).

## Changes

- Increase code coverage! (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/4410)

# 0.5.0 / 2020-08-20

This version of Lotus will be used for the incentivized testnet Space Race competition,
and can be considered mainnet-ready code. It includes some protocol
changes, upgrades of core dependencies, and various bugfixes and UX/performance improvements.

## Highlights

Among the highlights included in this release are:

- Gas changes: We implemented EIP-1559 and introduced real gas values.
- Deal-making: We now support "Committed Capacity" sectors, "fast-retrieval" deals,
  and the packing of multiple deals into a single sector.
- Renamed features: We renamed some of the binaries, environment variables, and default
  paths associated with a Lotus node.

### Gas changes

We made some significant changes to the mechanics of gas in this release.

#### Network fee

We implemented something similar to
[Ethereum's EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
The `Message` structure had three changes:
- The `GasPrice` field has been removed
- A new `GasFeeCap` field has been added, which controls the maximum cost
  the sender incurs for the message
- A new `GasPremium` field has been added, which controls the reward a miner
  earns for including the message

A sender will never be charged more than `GasFeeCap * GasLimit`.
A miner will typically earn `GasPremium * GasLimit` as a reward.

The `Blockheader` structure has one new field, called `ParentBaseFee`.
Informally speaking,the `ParentBaseFee`
is increased when blocks are densely packed with messages, and decreased otherwise.

The `ParentBaseFee` is used when calculating how much a sender burns when executing a message. _Burning_ simply refers to sending attoFIL to a dedicated, unreachable account.
A message causes `ParentBaseFee * GasUsed` attoFIL to be burnt.

#### Real gas values

This release also includes our first "real" gas costs for primitive operations.
The costs were designed to account for both the _time_ that message execution takes,
as well as the _space_ a message adds to the state tree.

## Deal-making changes

There are three key changes to the deal-making process.

#### Committed Capacity sectors

Miners can now pledge "Committed Capacity" (CC) sectors, which are explicitly
stated as containing junk data, and must not include any deals. Miners can do this
to increase their storage power, and win block rewards from this pledged storage.

They can mark these sectors as "upgradable" with `lotus-miner sectors mark-for-upgrade`.
If the miner receives and accepts one or more storage deals, the sector that includes
those deals will _replace_ the CC sector. This is intended to maximize the amount of useful
storage on the Filecoin network.

#### Fast-retrieval deals

Clients can now include a `fast-retrieval` flag when proposing deals with storage miners.
If set to true, the miner will include an extra copy of the deal data. This
data can be quickly served in a retrieval deal, since it will not need to be unsealed.

#### Multiple deals per sector

Miners can now pack multiple deals into a single sector, so long as all the deals
fit into the sector capacity. This should increase the packing efficiency of miners.

### Renamed features

To improve the user experience, we updated several names to mainatin
standard prefixing, and to better reflect the meaning of the features being referenced.

In particular, the Lotus miner binary is now called `lotus-miner`, the default
path for miner data is now `~/.lotusminer`, and the environment variable
that sets the path for miner data is now `$LOTUS_MINER_PATH`. A full list of renamed
features can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/2304).
