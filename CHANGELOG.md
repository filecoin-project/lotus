# Lotus changelog

# 0.5.6 / 2020-08-29

Hotfix release that fixes a panic in the sealing scheduler (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3389).

# 0.5.5

This patch release introduces a large number of improvements to the sealing process.
It also updates go-fil-markets to 
[version 0.5.8](https://github.com/filecoin-project/go-fil-markets/releases/tag/v0.5.8),
and go-libp2p-pubsub to [v0.3.5](https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p-pubsub/releases/tag/v0.3.5).

#### Downstream upgrades

- Upgrades markets to v0.5.8 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3384)
- Upgrades go-libp2p-pubsub to v0.3.5 (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3305)

#### Sector sealing

- The following improvements were introduced in https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3350.

    - Allow `lotus-miner sectors remove` to remove a sector in any state.
    - Create a separate state in the storage FSM dedicated to submitting the Commit message.
    - Recovery for when the Deal IDs of deals in a sector get changed in a reorg.
    - Auto-retry sending Precommit and Commit messages if they run out of gas
    - Auto-retry sector remove tasks when they fail
    - Compact worker windows, and allow their tasks to be executed in any order

- Don't simply skip PoSt for bad sectors (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3323)

#### Message Pool 

- Spam Protection: Track required funds for pending messages (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3313)

#### Chainwatch

- Fix raciness in sector deal table (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3275)
- Parallelize miner processing (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3380)
- Accept Lotus API and token (https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/3337)

# 0.5.4

A patch release, containing a few nice bugfixes and improvements:

- Fix parsing of peer ID in `lotus-miner actor set-peer-id` (@whyrusleeping)
- Update dependencies, fixing several bugs (@Stebalien)
- Fix remaining linter warnings (@Stebalien)
- Use safe string truncation (@Ingar)
- Allow tweaking of blocksync message window size (@whyrusleeping)
- Add some additional gas stats to metrics (@Kubuxu)
- Fix an edge case bug in message selection, add many tests (@vyzo)

# 0.5.3

Yet another hotfix release. 
A lesson for readers, having people who have been awake for 12+ hours review
your hotfix PR is not a good idea. Find someone who has enough slept recently
enough to give you good code review, otherwise you'll end up quickly bumping
versions again.

- Fixed a bug in the mempool that was introduced in v0.5.2

# 0.5.2 / 2020-08-24

This is a hotfix release.

- Fix message selection to not include messages that are invalid for block
  inclusion.
- Improve SelectMessage handling of the case where the message pools tipset
  differs from our mining base.

# 0.5.1 / 2020-08-24

The Space Race release! 
This release contains the genesis car file and bootstrap peers for the space
race network. 

Additionally, we included two small fixes to genesis creation:
- Randomize ticket value in genesis generation
- Correctly set t099 (burnt funds actor) to have valid account actor state

# 0.5.0 / 2020-08-20

This version of Lotus will be used for the incentivized testnet Space Race competition,
and can be considered mainnet-ready code. It includes some protocol
changes, upgrades of core dependencies, and various bugfixes and UX/performance improvements.

## Highlights

Among the highlights included in this release are:

- Gas changes: We implemented EIP-1559 and introduced real gas values.
- Deal-making: We now support "Committed Capacity" sectors, "fast-retrieval" deals,
and the packing of multiple deals into a single sector.
- Renamed features: We renamed some of the binaries, environment variables, and default
paths associated with a Lotus node.

### Gas changes

We made some significant changes to the mechanics of gas in this release.

#### Network fee

We implemented something similar to 
[Ethereum's EIP-1559](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md).
The `Message` structure had three changes:
- The `GasPrice` field has been removed
- A new `GasFeeCap` field has been added, which controls the maximum cost
the sender incurs for the message
- A new `GasPremium` field has been added, which controls the reward a miner
earns for including the message

A sender will never be charged more than `GasFeeCap * GasLimit`. 
A miner will typically earn `GasPremium * GasLimit` as a reward.

The `Blockheader` structure has one new field, called `ParentBaseFee`. 
Informally speaking,the `ParentBaseFee`
is increased when blocks are densely packed with messages, and decreased otherwise.

The `ParentBaseFee` is used when calculating how much a sender burns when executing a message. _Burning_ simply refers to sending attoFIL to a dedicated, unreachable account.
A message causes `ParentBaseFee * GasUsed` attoFIL to be burnt.

#### Real gas values

This release also includes our first "real" gas costs for primitive operations.
The costs were designed to account for both the _time_ that message execution takes,
as well as the _space_ a message adds to the state tree.

## Deal-making changes

There are three key changes to the deal-making process.

#### Committed Capacity sectors

Miners can now pledge "Committed Capacity" (CC) sectors, which are explicitly
stated as containing junk data, and must not include any deals. Miners can do this
to increase their storage power, and win block rewards from this pledged storage.

They can mark these sectors as "upgradable" with `lotus-miner sectors mark-for-upgrade`.
If the miner receives and accepts one or more storage deals, the sector that includes
those deals will _replace_ the CC sector. This is intended to maximize the amount of useful
storage on the Filecoin network.

#### Fast-retrieval deals

Clients can now include a `fast-retrieval` flag when proposing deals with storage miners.
If set to true, the miner will include an extra copy of the deal data. This
data can be quickly served in a retrieval deal, since it will not need to be unsealed.

#### Multiple deals per sector

Miners can now pack multiple deals into a single sector, so long as all the deals
fit into the sector capacity. This should increase the packing efficiency of miners.

### Renamed features

To improve the user experience, we updated several names to mainatin
standard prefixing, and to better reflect the meaning of the features being referenced.

In particular, the Lotus miner binary is now called `lotus-miner`, the default
path for miner data is now `~/.lotusminer`, and the environment variable
that sets the path for miner data is now `$LOTUS_MINER_PATH`. A full list of renamed
features can be found [here](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues/2304).
