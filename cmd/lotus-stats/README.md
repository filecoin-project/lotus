# lotus-stats

`lotus-stats` is a small tool to push chain information into influxdb

## Setup

Influx configuration can be configured through env variables.

```
LOTUS_STATS_INFLUX_ADDR="http://localhost:8086"
LOTUS_STATS_INFLUX_USER=""
LOTUS_STATS_INFLUX_PASS=""
```

## Usage

lotus-stats will look in `~/.lotus` to connect to a running daemon and resume collecting stats from last record block height.

For other usage see `./lotus-stats --help`

```
go build -o lotus-stats *.go 
. env.stats && ./lotus-stats run
```

For large networks there is an additional query in the `Top Miner Power` table, which can be toggled on to only show miners larger
than 1 PiB. This is a good option to enable to reduce the number of miners listed when viewing mainnet stats.

## Development

Start grafana and influxdb containers and import the dashboard to grafana.
The url of the imported dashboard will be returned.

If the script doesn't work, you can manually setup the datasource and import the dashboard.

```
docker-compose up -d
./setup.bash
```

The default username and password for grafana are both `admin`.

## Updating the dashboard

After importing the provided dashboard in `chain.dashboard.json`, you may make changes to the dashboard. To export
the dashboard to be commited back to the project, make sure the option "sharing externally" is toggled on.
