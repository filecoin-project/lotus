# Contributing to Lotus

Lotus is a universally open project and welcomes contributions of all kinds: code, docs, and more. We appreciate your interest in contributing!

## Before Contributing

1. If the proposal entails a protocol change, please first submit a [Filecoin Improvement Proposal](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs).
2. If the change is complex and requires prior discussion, [open an issue](github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/issues) or a [discussion](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/discussions) to request feedback before you start working on a pull request. This is to avoid disappointment and sunk costs, in case the change is not actually needed or accepted.
3. Please refrain from submitting PRs to adapt existing code to subjective preferences. The changeset should contain functional or technical improvements/enhancements, bug fixes, new features, or some other clear material contribution. Simple stylistic changes are likely to be rejected in order to reduce code churn.

## Implementing Changes

When implementing a change:

1. Adhere to the standard Go formatting guidelines, e.g. [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). Run `go fmt`.
2. Stick to the idioms and patterns used in the codebase. Familiar-looking code has a higher chance of being accepted than eerie code. Pay attention to commonly used variable and parameter names, avoidance of naked returns, error handling patterns, etc.
3. Comments: follow the advice on the [Commentary](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#commentary) section of Effective Go.
4. Minimize code churn. Modify only what is strictly necessary. Well-encapsulated changesets will get a quicker response from maintainers.
5. Lint your code with [`golangci-lint`](https://golangci-lint.run) (CI will reject your PR if unlinted).
6. Add tests.
7. Write clean, thoughtful, and detailed [commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). This is even more important than the PR description, because commit messages are stored _inside_ the Git history. One good rule is: if you are happy posting the commit message as the PR description, then it's a good commit message.

## PR Title Conventions

PR titles should follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard.
This means the PR title should be in the form of `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
  - example: `fix(mempool): introduce a cache for valid signatures`
  - `type`: MUST be one of _build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test_
  - `scope`: OPTIONAL arbitrary string that is usually one of _api, chain, deps, mempool, multisig, networking, paych, proving, sealing, state, wallet_
  - Breaking changes must add a `!`
  - Optionally the PR title can be prefixed with `[skip changelog]` if no changelog edits should be made for this change.

Note that this is enforced with https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/.github/workflows/pr-title-check.yml

## CHANGELOG Management

To expedite the release process, the CHANGELOG is built-up incrementally.  
We enforce that each PR updates CHANGELOG.md or signals that the change doesn't need it.
If the PR affects users (e.g., new feature, bug fix, system requirements change), update the CHANGELOG.md and add details to the UNRELEASED section.
If the change does not require a CHANGELOG.md entry, do one of the following:
- Add `[skip changelog]` to the PR title
- Add the label `skip/changelog` to the PR

Note that this is enforced with https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/blob/master/.github/workflows/changelog.yml
