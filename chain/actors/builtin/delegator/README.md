# Delegator Actor (Deprecated on this branch)

This scaffold is deprecated on the EIP‑7702 development branch. EthAccount state plus the
ref‑fvm VM intercept now implement 7702 end‑to‑end (state, validation, ApplyAndCall bridge,
pointer semantics), and no Delegator actor is used in send/execute paths. See AGENTS.md and
`documentation/eip7702_ethaccount_ref-fvm_migration.md` for the current design.
